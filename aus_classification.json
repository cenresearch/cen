    "title": "Parameter Identification of a Flexible-Joint Robot Axis using Sinusoidal Position Tracking — Rached Dhaouadi",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for identifying the mechanical parameters of flexible-joint robot axes using sinusoidal position tracking control. Accurate knowledge of mechanical parameters, such as inertia, coupling stiffness, and friction components, is important for designing effective controllers in robotic systems. These parameters are determined from integral values derived from the torque, speed, and position measurements of both the motor and load sides, leveraging the 90∘ phase relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration terms. A robust sinusoidal position controller was developed, and the speed and position measurements of both the motor and load sides were utilized to implement the proposed method. When compared with parameters identified using standard methods, the proposed method shows an absolute percentage error ranging from 3.55% to 14.6% for the inertias and coupling stiffness, and 10.76% to 19% for the friction coefficients. The straightforward implementation and effectiveness of this method make it suitable for applications in industrial robotic arms, where precise control is essential for enhancing performance and operational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) are crucial for defining system functionality, constraints, and objectives, particularly in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles (AV). Ensuring these requirements are precise, unambiguous, and complete is important for developing reliable self-driving systems. While traditional SRS are predominantly text-based, AV requirements pose unique challenges as they often include visual elements such as images and diagrams. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced traditional text-based requirements, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain largely unexplored for evaluating defects in visual elements. This paper investigates the few-shot performance of three large-scale VLMs on their ability to detect various types of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and incompleteness in visual traffic scenario images that could be used in AV requirements specifications. Using Soft prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, we evaluated the effectiveness of GPT-4, GEMINI, and ClaudeAI in detecting six types of visual defects. GPT-4 achieved the highest overall performance among the evaluated models, with the highest F1-score of 0.63 in detecting Spatial Incompleteness. CoT prompting notably enhanced defect detection performance for both GEMINI and ClaudeAI across all defect types. While CoT prompting did not significantly improve GPT-4’s detection capabilities, it significantly enhanced the ability of all models to explain the reasoning behind the identified defects. Despite promising results, none of the models could fully automate the requirements validation process, primarily due to their lack of domain-specific knowledge. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that fine tuning the models and structured prompt design offer the potential to improve VLM precision in visual defect detection."

The efficiency offered by DC motors make them integral to energy-saving propulsion systems, supporting the development of sustainable transportation technologies. However, despite their advantages, DC motors face significant challenges in complex systems, such as precise speed regulation and consistent acceleration or deceleration. Traditional control schemes, such as Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers, often fall short in addressing these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, this study leverages DRL, specifically the Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, to learn an optimal control policy in a simulation environment. A comprehensive simulation model of a DC motor is developed in MATLAB Simulink to mimic the system's dynamic behavior. The proposed approach is then compared to the traditional PI controller to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the DDPG-based controller in terms of speed regulation accuracy, thus highlighting the potential of advanced DRL techniques in addressing the challenges associated with DC motor control."

This study demonstrates the application of UAVs to assess Jhum cultivation in Khawrihnim village, Mamit district, India, responding to the increasing demand for fine-scale, real-time spatial data in agriculture, water resources, and forest management in the region. UAVs facilitated in the development of high-resolution land use-land cover (LULC) maps, showing that moderately dense forests covered the largest portion of the area (38.37%), followed by current Jhum land (7.96%) and older Jhum land (5.71%). Digital elevation models (DEMs) indicated that Jhum cultivation was predominantly concentrated at lower elevations (149–600 m). Soil nutrient mapping using Kriging demonstrated key spatial trends, with nitrogen (N) increasing from hilltops to lower slopes, phosphorus (P) concentrated on backslope areas, and potassium (K) in lower slopes. Site suitability analysis using multi-criteria decision-making classified 18.97% of the area as very highly suitable for Jhum cultivation, with most zones in the northern and northwestern regions. A significant advancement from this study is the development of the “Heliware” online portal, which integrates UAV-derived data with advanced geospatial tools. The platform enables crop and soil nutrient mapping, 3D visualization, hydrological modeling, and real-time scenario planning. The findings from this study, highlight the transformative potential of UAVs and geospatial platforms for localized agricultural and environmental challenges, thereby offering a replicable framework for precision agriculture and sustainable resource management.

The solar-powered quadcopter is tested via virtual simulation taking into account the actual model of the quadrotor. All parameters used are based on a prototype obtained by SolidWorks. Both the weight and size of the solar-powered quadrotor are large due to the presence of the solar cells. Power demand will therefore increase. Optimal sizing is essential for selecting the quadrotor structure and solar cell arrays. The large size also leads to a flexible structure with bending modes, which will be challenging for the control system design. A dedicated energy management system will manage the generated power from the solar cells and supply the power demand. A backup battery will be used as an alternate power supply when the solar energy is intermitted due to cloud shading. For commercial quadrotors, the proposed solution will allow for longer flights and fewer stopovers at recharging stations. Thus a small size backup battery is sufficient on-board for emergency use. The decreased battery size allows for significant savings in energy costs yielding a self-sustainable quadrotor that can fly for a longer period of time.

The bio-inspired propulsion tail consists of a passive caudal fin attached to three articulated segments each actuated by a servomotor to produce desired deformations. Representing these deformations by analytical functions, the linkage lengths of the three segments are optimized using Simscape. A testing platform, equipped with a load cell and a distance laser sensor, is developed to measure and validate the predicted thrust and forward speed over a range of undulation frequencies and amplitudes of lateral oscillations. Static thrust values are also compared to their theoretical counterparts obtained from Lighthill's theory of elongated bodies' propulsion. The results show that the locomotion modes alone can impact the swimming performance over an unchanging morphology. The experimental results further indicate that synchronicity of locomotion parameters found in nature has a greater effect on the overall thrust than varying a specific parameter."

    "abstract": "Conventionally, aerial manipulators, when used for inspection, use drone rotors to stabilize the center of gravity (CoG) shifts, which highly affects its performance. This paper discusses the development of a self-balancing lightweight cable aerial manipulator that can be used for construction inspection purposes. The design is based on a 3D-printed, three degrees of freedom (DoF), planar cable manipulator that is mounted on an extended platform below it as a counter-balance mechanism. The actuators control the manipulator links through a cable system, allowing them to be mounted at the system base to reduce the moving mass of the manipulator during operation. The counter-balance mechanism compensates for any shifts in the CoG of the system by actively sliding a counter-balance weight, mainly a battery, which powers the setup. This mechanism can be attached beneath an off-the-shelf quadrotor to solve the problem of CoG shifts. CoG shifts are due to the manipulator operation when a payload or inspection tool is attached to the end effector to perform a given task. For construction integrity inspection, the aerial manipulator must remain stable during the push or slide processes on both flat and curved surfaces while the non-destructive tests are carried out. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, an experimental setup was used, and comparisons were made between the compensated and uncompensated tilt angles of the aerial manipulator. Significant tilt angle reductions were observed with an average of 94.69% improvement, undergoing different manipulator motions during different operation scenarios, as a result of an active compensation of the CoG shift and lightweight design of the system, without sacrificing the functionality of the manipulator for the task."

In this work, sizing and weight estimation for a MFWD are conducted following the establishment of a mission plan. Aerodynamic simulations are generated to select the appropriate wing shape and airfoil section to satisfy the design requirements of the proposed drone. Then, a stability analysis is carried out to determine the relative position of the aerodynamic center with respect to the center of gravity. Subsequently, a tail sizing procedure is performed based on the calculated length of the tail arm identified from the stability analysis, and a flapping mechanism is designed based on a common configuration reported in the literature.

This paper introduces a novel optimization framework to decide on the optimal source or mix of sources to be installed on drones to minimize their running cost. The proposed approach considers three sources: batteries, fuel cells, and super-capacitors, the characteristics of which are embedded in the optimal selection approach. In addition, a drone aerodynamic model is incorporated, which is composed of four actions: hovering, ascending, descending, and moving forward. The proposed approach selects the optimal source(s) from a defined database of sources to power the drone according to the user-specified trip profile.

The use of such grouping arrangement and organized pattern has demonstrated longer endurance and less power consumption in comparison with single flights. In this work, a computationally efficient potential flow solver based on the unsteady vortex lattice method (UVLM) is employed to assess the aerodynamic performance of flapping wings in forward flight in terms of lift and thrust generation along with the propulsive efficiency. The UVLM has the capability to simulate incompressible and inviscid flows over moving thin wings where the separation lines are known a priori. A bio-inspired, albatross wing shape is considered and its aerodynamic performance in formation flights is compared against conventional elliptical and rectangular wing shapes. The aerodynamic analysis is carried out for different wing arrangements of 3-body and 5-body V-formations to determine the optimal spacing parameters leading to maximum propulsive efficiency. The simulation results reveal that, at the optimal formation angle and separation distance, the albatross-inspired wing shape produces the most lift over the flapping cycle, while the rectangular wing shape generates the most thrust over the flapping cycle. Furthermore, the optimal configuration in terms of propulsive efficiency is found to be a 5-body V-formation utilizing the albatross wing shape with a separation distance set to one-third of the span and a formation angle set to 139°. The present study provides guidance for the design of multi-flapping wing air vehicles based on the expected flight mission. The albatross wing shape is found to have superior capability in producing lift, while the elliptical wing shape is observed to consume less power. The rectangular wing shape is found to produce higher thrust and then can achieve faster forward motion."

These forces depend on the relative position and relative velocity between the UAV and respective obstacles. As a result, the UAV is attracted to a moving or stationary target and repulsed away from moving or static obstacles simultaneously in 3D space. Accordingly, it changes its altitude and projected planner position concurrently. A real-time implementation for the system is conducted in the SPACE laboratory to perform motion planning in 3D space. The system performance is validated in real-time experiments using three platforms: two parrot bebop drones and one turtlebot robot. The pose information of the vehicles is estimated using six Vicon cameras during real-time flights. The demonstrated results show the motion planning system's effectiveness. Also, we propose a successful mathematical solution of the local minima problem associated with the potential field method in both stationary and dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "This chapter reviews the mathematical formulations of serial and parallel robots. The main objective is to show the complexity of parallel robots models compared to those obtained for serial manipulators. The diversity of designs found in parallel robots makes a standard representation almost impossible. For serial robots, the structure, as the name indicates, is an open kinematic chain and hence all the links have two joints except the first one, the base, and the last one, the end-effector (EE). This type of structure allows a simple and standard geometric description, where the most famous one was introduced by Denavit-Hartenberg in the 50s. This standard geometric description allows a systematic mathematical formulation of the kinematic model, which could be easily automated. However, parallel robots have different structures, specific for each robot, where closed kinematic chains are used to connect the base to the EE. The use of closed kinematic chains made the use of a standard geometric description almost impossible. Each case has its particularity and requires a specific description. Therefore, the resulting kinematic model is also specific to the robot. Moreover, two challenges were added in the case of parallel robots. In their serial counterpart, all the joints are active and limited to Revolute or Prismatic joints. However, parallel robots usually have several passive joints, which adds extra variables in the equations of the resulting geometric model. Due to this complexity, researchers proposed several parallel robots with less than 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) and, in particular, translational ones and purely rotational ones (spherical). In this chapter, examples selected from both types were modelled and the forward and inverse problems were solved analytically, when possible."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the performance of a hybrid propulsion mechanism for a robotic fish based on the combined bending and flapping motions of a flexible tail with a bioinspired caudal fin extension. The tail consists of an Aluminum substrate attached to a pair of macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric laminates and subject to flapping motion actuated by a servomotor. A testing platform, equipped with a distance laser sensor, is developed to measure the produced tail deformation over a range of actuation frequencies and amplitudes of lateral oscillations. The objective is to verify the biomimicry of the system and identify the optimal actuation that maximizes the thrust generation of the propulsive tail. Optimal actuation entails the vibration of the MFC at resonance and utilizing its dynamic model to synchronize its motion with that of a motor to produce a biomimetic motion. Frequency response curves are generated and verified against a model of underwater beam dynamics. The experimental component of the present work also includes the development of a robotic fish prototype that encompasses a main 3d-printed body designed as a streamlined waterproof enclosure of the electronics including a microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi camera module, and a highvoltage amplifier along with a servomotor actuating the bioinspired tail. The mass distribution of the electronic components is adjusted to ensure the buoyancy of the robotic fish in water. Free-swimming tests of the robot are successfully conducted to demonstrate the performance of the hybrid propulsion mechanism in terms of forward swimming speed and maneuverability. The performance is then compared against other robotic fish works and found to provide a higher propulsion compared to smart material-based designs while also providing a smaller design compared to the motor-based solutions."

Most of the present work on autonomous navigation in dynamic environments does not take into account the dynamics of the obstacles.

One problem facing the DWA is how to optimize the weights of its objective function to allow the robot to move towards the goal while avoiding collisions in all environments. The main contribution of this paper is to build an intelligent system that will be able to optimize the objective function weights of the dynamic window to make it more resilient to changes and moves as fast as possible towards the goal using fuzzy logic system. The proposed new adaptive controller was able to reduce the failure rate of the DWA from 20% to only five per cent in static environments, and maintain more than 60% success rate in dynamic environments with up to 25 obstacles/100 m2, on the other hand the basic algorithm was failing to less than 50% with 15 obstacles/100 m2."

    "title": "Design and Optimization of a UAV-Enabled Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Edge Computing IoT System — Mahmoud H. Ismail",
    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) in IoT systems has recently gained prominence as a solution to accommodate the low latency and high energy efficiency needs of emerging and developing 5G-and-beyond IoT applications. Given the limited spectrum available, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication scheme provides a spectral-and power-efficient task offloading means. In this work, a novel framework is proposed for a multiple-UAV-enabled MEC IoT system incorporating uplink NOMA. The goal is to maximize the sum bits offloaded from all the IoT devices (IoTDs) in a finite service period. This is achieved through joint optimization of the associations between the IoTDs and the UAVs, the IoTD transmit powers, as well as the UAV trajectories, given UAV and IoTD energy budgets and quality-of-service (QoS) criteria. Towards that end, a specialized penalty block coordinate descent (P-BCD) algorithm is proposed to decompose the original problem into 4 subproblems that are solved alternately and iteratively. By direct comparison with several benchmark schemes including orthogonal multiple access (OMA), our proposed scheme displays performance enhancement in terms of sum bits offloaded and energy expenditure. Finally, a performance comparison is carried out for the proposed scheme with different number of employed UAVs to find the most cost-effective number of UAVs to deploy."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design issues, dynamic modeling, and feedback control problems for quadcopters having a large frame with mechanical flexibility. This situation occurs for example for the case of solar quadcopters that require a large structure to have onboard PV panels for the power supply and battery recharging. Flexibility may manifests itself as mechanical oscillations and static deflections, greatly complicating the motion control of a quadcopter platform. If the time to settle the oscillations is significant relative to the cycle time of the overall task, flexibility will be a major consideration in the flight control design, and a degradation of the overall expected system performance typically occurs. For quadcopters with flexible frames, it is difficult to use the Euler-Lagrange or Newtonian approach to derive the dynamic model as is done with small and rigid quadrotors. Many relevant factors that lead to the consideration of the distributed flexibility should be analyzed. To deal with this challenge, an optimal approach for sizing the frame and platform structure is followed. This is achieved by using a modern approach to computer modeling of quadcopters through the integration process of SolidWorks CAD modeling and MATLAB/Simulink environments. This is followed by identifying the resonant frequencies of the model using ANSYS Workbench. Initially, a SolidWorks model is created and then imported into MATLAB Simscape Multibody. Then, the transfer functions of the quadrotor model are derived using system identification. Subsequently, the equivalent transfer functions from the Simulink model are obtained and used for the PID controllers design. The validity of the quadcopter model represents an essential step to simulate the model before flying the quadcopter in the real world. It brings confidence that when the commands are run on the actual quadrotor, they will bring the same results. The design procedure for modeling a dynamical model of a large quadcopter and the tuning of its PID-based control strategies has been successfully implemented for a solar-quadcopter prototype, creating a reliable and effective automatic navigation and control system."

This work is motivated by the need to find the optimal CDPR for upper limb rehabilitation allowing to assist the patient's hand along a set of prescribed tasks. Firstly, a reconfigurable robot, where the motors' locations are movable, is proposed in order to help reaching all the prescribed poses. Although this solution presents promising results compared to classical CDPRs, it involves a sizable robot structure inadequate to rehabilitation application. To improve the obtained solution, another approach is proposed, based on combining the large translational workspace of CDPRs and the large rotational workspace of serial manipulators.

One of the most promising approaches is to use model-based testing (MBT), in which test automation is based on a model of the implementation under test (IUT), with much of the work concerning finite state machine (FSM) models. Many FSM-based test generation techniques use, possibly adaptive, sequences to check the state of the IUT. Of particular interest are adaptive distinguishing sequences (ADSs) because their use can lead to relatively small tests. However, not all systems possess an ADS. In this work, we generalise the notion of incomplete ADSs to non-deterministic partial and observable FSMs. We show that the problem of checking the existence of a set of kk incomplete ADSs that separates every pair of states is PSPACE-hard. Further, we generalise the notion of invertible sequences to non-deterministic partial and observable FSMs and show how invertible sequences can be used to derive additional incomplete ADSs. We propose a novel algorithm to generate incomplete ADSs and describe the results of experiments that evaluated its performance. The results indicate that the proposed method can generate sequences to identify states of the IUT and is faster and can process larger FSMs than other existing methods."

Thus, power lines need to be timely inspected, especially before or during emergency-related situations to ensure stable operation of the power grid.

This article proposes a novel approach for the post-disaster UAV-based damage assessment of overhead power lines. In the proposed approach, the UAVs paths over the most critical loads are formulated as an optimisation problem with the objective of minimising the total inspection time while considering the recharging of the UAVs' batteries. To solve the problem, an efficient framework that optimises the UAVs flight paths is proposed to inspect the critical loads in an efficient order, while accounting for the UAV recharging. This guarantees that the UAVs complete the assessment tasks unlike existing benchmarks."

Recently, separate solar panel arrays or units are commonly installed on residential, commercial rooftops or roads, making it inconvenient for land robots to perform the cleaning tasks. The proposed light weight solar panel cleaning aerial manipulator with the gravity compensation mechanism is intended to be attached beneath a drone to increase its stability during operation. The manipulator workspace given the proposed system is analyzed under CoG shift constraints. The kinematics and dynamics of the aerial manipulator coupled with the compensation mechanism are presented, and a path-planning scheme for solar panel cleaning is detailed. A dynamic control law based on pitch and counterweight position reduced-order dynamics is derived, and its equivalence to the static compensation law is shown. An experimental test bench is used to simulate the aerial manipulation during operations to validate the performance of the proposed manipulator and its stability. Its tilting pitch angle is collected and examined during operation. The results show that the system is less susceptible to unwanted tilting. A tilt angle reduction of 2 degrees was observed between an uncompensated and compensated system, with a difference in shift of CoG location of 1.72% of the total system length. The CoG location shift is also simulated without the presence of a slider mechanism and shows a difference of 24.5% with the compensated system. The compensation mechanism significantly reduces the tilt angle, avoiding potential instability, and consequently decreases the power required by the carrying drone."

    "title": "LocIn: Inferring Semantic Location from Spatial Maps in Mixed Reality — Reham Mohamed",
    "abstract": "Mixed reality (MR) devices capture 3D spatial maps of users' surroundings to integrate virtual content into their physical environment. Existing permission models implemented in popular MR platforms allow all MR apps to access these 3D spatial maps without explicit permission. Unmonitored access of MR apps to these 3D spatial maps poses serious privacy threats to users as these maps capture detailed geometric and semantic characteristics of users' environments. In this paper, we present LOCIN, a new location inference attack that exploits these detailed characteristics embedded in 3D spatial maps to infer a user's indoor location type. LOCIN develops a multi-task approach to train an end-to-end encoder-decoder network that extracts a spatial feature representation for capturing contextual patterns of the user's environment. LOCIN leverages this representation to detect 3D objects and surfaces and integrates them into a classification network with a novel unified optimization function to predict the user's indoor location. We demonstrate LOCIN attack on spatial maps collected from three popular MR devices. We show that LOCIN infers a user's location type with an average 84.1% accuracy."

    "title": "A real‐time fuzzy motion planning system for unmanned aerial vehicles in dynamic 3D environments — Mohammad A. Jaradat",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a new fuzzy potential system to plan the motion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic 3D Space. The system consists of two fuzzy subsystems representing the attractive model and the repulsive model of virtual forces in 3D. The attractive model will generate the attractive force required to pull the UAV in a smooth and optimized trajectory to land softly on a moving or stationary target. The repulsive model will generate the required repulsive force to avoid stationary or moving obstacles in 3D Space. The attractive fuzzy inference system takes the relative position and relative velocity between UAV and the target in the x, y, and z directions as inputs. It generates the required attractive force in the x, y, and z directions. The repulsive fuzzy inference system takes the relative position between UAV and obstacle in the xyz directions as input. Fuzzy associative memory (FAM) models the inputs and generates the required repulsive force in the x, y, and z directions. As a result, the UAV is considered to be moving under the influence of fuzzy virtual attractive and repulsive forces simultaneously. Accordingly, it will be able to change both its altitude and projected planner position concurrently and resolves the local minima problem if occurred. On the other hand, many classical models in dynamic environments require several additional inputs, such as the relative position and relative velocity, which increase the requirement on the measurement system to localize the moving objects in the 3D Space. Several experiments were performed and discussed to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed motion planner with real-time implementations. The system performance was validated using three robotics platforms, two quadcopter drones, and one ground robot. The position and orientation of each robot were defined using a motion capture system with 6 opti-track cameras. The motion planning system produces a quadcopter drone's efficient and accurate low-frequency trajectory. The generated trajectory allows the drone to track the ground robot and avoid collision effectively with the second drone in the vicinity."

In this paper, a logarithmic detector coupled with a high-speed full-wave rectifier is designed for an RSSI system.

This system is intended to operate in a scenario where multiple drones in a smart farm are charged wirelessly whilst airborne. An RSSI is placed in the receiver to detect and track wireless signals and to ensure the drone is charged while in motion. The RSSI system operates at 5.8 GHz, reported for the first time, and is capable of detecting signal strengths from −60 dBm to 0 dBm with a sensitivity level of 17 mV/dBm. A logarithmic error of 0.4 dB with a dynamic range of 34 dB was achieved.

The proposed sensor fusion approach uses depth-based localization data to enhance the accuracy obtained by the inertial measurement unit (IMU) pose data through a depth-inertial fusion. The fusion approach is based on feedforward cascade correlation networks (CCNs). The aim of this fusion approach is to correct the drift accompanied by the use of the IMU sensor, using a depth camera. This approach also has the advantage of maintaining the high frequency of the IMU sensor and the accuracy of the depth camera. The estimated mobile robot dynamic states through the proposed approach are deployed and examined through real-time autonomous navigation. It is shown that using both the planned path and the continuous localization approach, the robot successfully controls its movement toward the destination. Several tests were conducted with different numbers of layers and percentages of the training set. It is shown that the best performance is obtained with 12 layers and 80% of the pose data used as a training set for CCN. The proposed framework is then compared to the solution based on fusing the information given by the XSens IMU-GPS sensor and the Kobuki robot built-in odometry solution. As demonstrated in the results, an enhanced performance was achieved with an average Euclidean error of 0.091 m by the CCN, which is lower than the error achieved by the artificial neural network by 56%."

    "abstract": "Testing is a crucial phase in the development of complex systems, and this has led to interest in automated test generation techniques based on state-based models. Many approaches use models that are types of finite state machine (FSM). Corresponding test generation algorithms typically require that certain test components, such as reset sequences (RSs) and preset distinguishing sequences (PDSs), have been produced for the FSM specification. Unfortunately, the generation of RSs and PDSs is computationally expensive, and this affects the scalability of such FSM-based test generation algorithms. This paper addresses this scalability problem by introducing a reinforcement learning framework: the Q-Graph framework for MBT. We show how this framework can be used in the generation of RSs and PDSs and consider both (potentially partial) timed and untimed models. The proposed approach was evaluated using three types of FSMs: randomly generated FSMs, FSMs from a benchmark, and an FSM of an Engine Status Manager for a printer. In experiments, the proposed approach was much faster and used much less memory than the state-of-the-art methods in computing PDSs and RSs."

For each position on the discretization grid, the rotation angle of the end-effector (EE) is incremented until a failure of the robot equilibrium, which identifies the maximum reachable rotation angle. The implemented algorithm was first applied to the classical 4-cable 3-Degree of Freedom (DoF) CDPR where the total orientation is found to be restricted. To obtain an unlimited orientation of the EE, a new design of a CDPR was introduced. This new design has 6 cables and 3-DoF.

The MRKFL-FTS technique includes Cloud RAN (C-RAN) and Virtual RAN (V-RAN). The proposed MRKFL-FTS technique comprises four entities, namely, IoT devices, cloud servers, task assigners, and virtual machines. Each IoT device generates several service requests and sends them to the control server. At first, radial kernelized support vector regression is applied in the local training model to identify resource-efficient virtual machines. After that, locally trained models are combined, and the resulting model is fed into the global aggregation model. Finally, using a weighted round-robin method, the task assigner allocates incoming IoT service requests to virtual machines. This approach improves resource awareness and fault tolerance in scheduling. The quantitatively analyzed results show that the MRKFL-FTS technique achieved an 8% improvement in task scheduling efficiency and fault prediction accuracy, a 36% improvement in throughput, and a 14% reduction in makespan and time complexity.

Existing sensor nodes’ localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes.

However, current camera traps suffer from two problems. First, the images are manually classified and counted, which is expensive.

This paper proposes an IoT architecture that uses deep learning on edge devices to convey animal classification results to a mobile app using the LoRaWAN low-power, wide-area network. The primary goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the cost of the wildlife monitoring process for ecologists, and to provide real-time animal sightings data from the camera traps in the field. Camera trap image data consisting of 66,400 images were used to train the InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception neural network models. While performance of the trained models was statistically different (Kruskal–Wallis: Accuracy H(5) = 22.34, p < 0.05; F1-score H(5) = 13.82, p = 0.0168), there was only a 3% difference in the F1-score between the worst (MobileNet V2) and the best model (Xception). Moreover, the models made similar errors (Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) > 0.88 and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMU) > 0.82). Subsequently, the best model, Xception (Accuracy = 96.1%; F1-score = 0.87; F1-Score = 0.97 with oversampling), was optimized and deployed on the Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, and Nvidia Jetson edge devices using both TenorFlow Lite and TensorRT frameworks. Optimizing the models to run on edge devices reduced the average macro F1-Score to 0.7, and adversely affected the minority classes, reducing their F1-score to as low as 0.18. Upon stress testing, by processing 1000 images consecutively, Jetson Nano, running a TensorRT model, outperformed others with a latency of 0.276 s/image (s.d. = 0.002) while consuming an average current of 1665.21 mA. Raspberry Pi consumed the least average current (838.99 mA) with a ten times worse latency of 2.83 s/image (s.d. = 0.036). Nano was the only reasonable option as an edge device because it could capture most animals whose maximum speeds were below 80 km/h, including goats, lions, ostriches, etc. While the proposed architecture is viable, unbalanced data remain a challenge and the results can potentially be improved by using object detection to reduce imbalances and by exploring semi-supervised learning."

    "abstract": "The remarkable growth in the demand for multimedia streaming over wireless networks is challenged by spectrum scarcity. To mitigate the effect of such a challenge, Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) were introduced as a promising technology since CRNs offer a great advantage to unlicensed users, also known as secondary users (SUs), by allowing them to opportunistically access the licensed bands when these bands are not used by their primary users (PUs). In this work, an LTE-based CRN is proposed with the objective of guaranteeing continuous video playback at the SUs end at acceptable perceptual quality. To accomplish this objective, different resource allocation schemes are introduced to adaptively assign the available channels to SUs while considering the quality of these channels as well as the buffer occupancies of the different SUs. In addition, a streaming algorithm is proposed to ensure the delivery of the base and enhancement layers of the scalable video frames within the delay constraints with priority given to the base-layers of the video frames to guarantee the continuity of video playback. Furthermore, adaptive modulation is used based on the channel state information (CSI) as fed-back by the SUs. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations."

Navigating around places is one of the biggest challenges that face visually impaired people, especially those with complete loss of vision. As the Internet of Things (IoT) concept starts to play a major role in smart cities applications, visually impaired people can be one of the benefitted clients. In this paper, we propose a smart IoT-based mobile sensors unit that can be attached to an off-the-shelf cane, hereafter a smart cane, to facilitate independent movement for visually impaired people. The proposed mobile sensors unit consists of a six-axis accelerometer/gyro, ultrasonic sensors, GPS sensor, cameras, a digital motion processor and a single credit-card-sized single-board microcomputer. The unit is used to collect information about the cane user and the surrounding obstacles while on the move. An embedded machine learning algorithm is developed and stored in the microcomputer memory to identify the detected obstacles and alarm the user about their nature. In addition, in case of emergencies such as a cane fall, the unit alerts the cane user and their guardian. Moreover, a mobile application is developed to be used by the guardian to track the cane user via Google Maps using a mobile handset to ensure safety.

    "abstract": "The remarkable increase in the number of interconnected smart devices in today's Internet of things networks introduces more challenges related to security, trust, and centralization, which require more effective solutions. Fortunately, blockchain technology has recently emerged as a potential rescuer for IoT-based solutions due to its decentralization and enhanced security features. It is usual for smart contracts to arise in handling and processing the generated data when IoT devices are combined with blockchain. However, blockchain and smart contracts need to interact with input data of the same level of trust to guarantee correct applications execution. This implies using oracles to provide trust compatibility between inserted information collected from IoT devices and blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, this study adopts a methodology that was shaped based on current literature and design and experiments to provide a full narrative of the process of combining two of the most intriguing systems in today's world of technology, namely, blockchain and IoT including a very important part of the comprehensive system, viz. blockchain oracle. Moreover, it was found that the literature lacks a complete view of the IoT-blockchain integration process that covers all its important and related aspects. Therefore, this work is an attempt to fill the gap in literature and contribute to the body of knowledge by surveying the literature about existing IoT-blockchain architectures and shed light on the role of blockchain in addressing IoT issues while demonstrating the concept of oracles as well as their functions in addition to the main operating blockchain oracles. Additionally, this work illustrates a CO2 measuring use case where a smart contract is developed and tested as part of two proposed oracle-based designs. The obtained results demonstrate a full picture of a practical integrated IoT-blockchain system architecture."

    "abstract": "In heterogeneous cluster-based information-centric wireless sensor networks (ICWSNs), sensor nodes acquire different application-specific data. They are clustered based on proximity, where cluster heads (CHs) act as cache nodes. Meanwhile, grouping sensor nodes based on the information type gathered can improve the ICWSN performance. Motivated by the heterogeneous nature of ICWSNs, application-specific communities can be formed within each cluster, where community leaders (CLs) can be selected to cache application-specific data. In this case, CHs gather aggregated data from CLs rather than basic sensing nodes. However, this creates an issue of the energy-latency and security tradeoff and affects user security satisfaction. In this work, we propose solving this issue by studying cluster-based ICWSNs with heterogeneous communities and comparing them to conventional heterogeneous cluster-based ICWSNs. Based on the formulated analytical model, we then propose SLAC-H, a security-level-aware CHs' and CLs' selection algorithm for cluster-based ICWSNs with heterogeneous communities. SLAC-H addresses the energy-latency and security issue by optimizing energy and coverage supported by sensor nodes in a cluster-based ICWSN with heterogeneous communities subject to security constraints. Simulation results show that compared to existing works, SLAC-H achieves lower latency and energy consumption while fulfilling higher user security satisfaction."

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are considered one of the prominent technologies to be adopted in 6G and beyond networks. However, one of the main IRS limitations is restricting the communication to the reflective dimension, which means that users located behind the IRS surface cannot benefit from it. In this paper, we make use of intelligent omni-surfaces (IOS), as an alternative to IRS, in addition to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to achieve secure communication in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) communication system. Specifically, we propose IOS-UAV assisted communication wherein an access point (AP) tries to send confidential information to a legitimate IoT device in presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV serves two fold; it acts as a friendly jammer that is trying to degrade the signal quality at the eavesdropper and as a source of energy to power up the IoT device via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to address the limited power available to it. We formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the AP and UAV transmission powers, the UAV trajectory, IOS phase shifts and power splitting factor. The formulated problem is non-convex, therefore we exploit successive convex approximation (SCA) to tackle this issue. Simulation results show that the iterative SCA solution converges rapidly. Besides, the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional system without IOS by a gap of 140% in terms of the secrecy capacity."

Symbiotic radio (SR) is considered one of the emerging technologies that aims at providing an energy-efficient solution for the ubiquitous IoT applications. In this paper, we propose an SR system that is assisted with a double-faced active intelligent reflecting surface (DFA-IRS). The proposed system consists of an active transmitter (AT), an active receiver (AR), a backscatter receiver (BR), a DFA-IRS, and an IoT device that is connected to the DFA-IRS. We formulated a BR spectral efficiency maximization problem via optimizing the active beamforming vector at the AT, the power amplification factors of the IRS active elements, and the IRS phase shift at each active element under the constraints of a maximum power budget and the AR spectral efficiency requirements. The formulated problem is non-convex due to the coupling between different variables. Hence, we divided the main problems into three sub-problems and utilized the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to obtain a convex equivalent problem that can be solved using conventional optimization tools such as CVX. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges in few number of iterations. Moreover, the proposed scheme achieves better BR spectral efficiency when compared to the case where a single-faced active IRS or a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting IRS (STAR-IRS) counterpart is used."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT). These are networks of sensor nodes that are clustered to collect and exchange locally sensed data. In each cluster, a cluster head (CH) gathers data from its cluster members, aggregates it, and sends it to the sink node. To serve IoT applications, the sink node then shares this data with the other CHs. Nevertheless, clustering a massive collection of sensor nodes is challenging. This is because these sensor nodes have limited energy resources and are distributed over a vast area. Recently, High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) have been shown to improve the connectivity in WSNs by serving as non-terrestrial sink nodes. The quasi-stationary nature of these non-terrestrial platforms can offer vast geographical coverage, and thus, improve WSNs' transmission reliability. This paper proposes HAPS-greedy clustering (HAPS-GC) of WSNs to support massive IoT applications. In contrast to existing HAPSbased WSN clustering schemes, HAPS-GC considers not only the connectivity between sensor nodes within each cluster but also their connectivity with HAPS. Simulation results show that the proposed HAPS-GC approach can significantly increase the WSN throughput while maintaining WSN energy consumption similar to the existing HAPS-based WSN clustering schemes and a scenario, where a terrestrial sink node is used."

Moreover, the ISAC-BS offloads part of the sensed data to a dedicated edge server for computation purposes. Additionally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is deployed to transmit jamming signals aimed at degrading the reception quality of malicious targets or potential eavesdroppers identified through the sensing process. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit/receive beamforming and UAV trajectory to maximize the communication sum spectral efficiency under radar performance, security, offloading, and power constraints. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we use alternating optimization (AO), semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) approaches to solve it. Simulation results show that the communication and radar achieved rates from the proposed algorithm outperforms the cases of using non-optimized UAV’s trajectory and using the Rayleigh-quotient method to design the receive beamforming vectors."

The parameters that are optimized include the elements' excitation amplitude, excitation phase, and positions. PSO is a stochastic algorithm that is known for solving N-dimensional optimization problems. The PSO algorithm is utilized to decide a set of parameters for the array's antenna elements, which provide the desired reduction levels for the sidelobes.

The first assessment determines for each pair of test suites if there is a difference between the pair in covering EFSM faults of six EFSM specifications. If the difference is found significant, we determine which test suite outperforms the other. The second assessment is similar to the first; yet, it is carried out against code faults of 12 Java implementations of the specifications. Besides, two assessments are provided to determine whether test suites have better coverage of certain classes of EFSM (or code) faults than others. The evaluation uses proper data transformation of mutation scores and p-value adjustments for controlling Type I error due to multiple tests. Furthermore, we show that subsuming mutants have an impact on mutation scores of both EFSM and code faults; and accordingly, we use a score that removes them in order not to invalidate the obtained results. The assessments show that all-uses tests were outperformed by all other tests; transition tours outperformed both edge-pair and prime path with side trips; and single-transfer fault tests outperformed all other test suites. Similar results are obtained over the considered EFSM and code fault domains, and there were no significant differences between the test suites coverage of different classes of EFSM and code faults."

The proposed model requires around 20% less coefficients than the reverse twin-nonlinear two-box model, and achieves slightly better ACLR while easing the analog implementation of the static nonlinearity predistortion function. Most importantly, the low-complexity hybrid implementation of the proposed model can drastically reduce the speed requirements in the digital to analog converter of the signal transmit path by up to 80% when compared to traditional DPD systems."

This is accompanied by extensive research in the area of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), thanks to their ability to improve the ISAC systems. In this paper, the physical layer security of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) ISAC system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we propose using an active RIS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the system through jointly designing the radar receive beamformers, the active RIS reflection coefficients matrix and the transmit beamformers at the dual-function base station of the ISAC system. This is done while taking into account a minimum radar detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total system power budget constraints. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques to achieve a solution. Our numerical results show the superiority of active RIS to achieve the goal when compared with passive RIS or with an ISAC without an RIS. Results also show that passive RIS could still be a viable solution to achieve this goal but at the expense of a much larger needed size especially when lower power budgets are available."

It is crucially important for manufacturing facilities to correctly identify the most suitable Industry 4.0 technologies that meet their operational schemes and production targets. Different technology selection frameworks were proposed to tackle this problem, several of which are complex, or require historic data from manufacturing facilities that might not always be available. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel Industry 4.0 selection framework that utilizes Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) to rank different Industry 4.0 technologies based on their economic, social, and environmental impact. The framework is also implemented on a real-life case study of a manufacturing firm to rank the different Industry 4.0 technologies required for its digital transformation based on their significance to the facility’s key performance indicators. The framework is utilized to select the top three Industry 4.0 technologies from a pool of eight technologies that are deemed important to the manufacturing firm. Results of the case study showed that Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data analytics, and autonomous/industrial robots are the top three ranked technologies, having closeness coefficient scores of 0.964, 0.928, and 0.601, respectively. Moreover, the framework showed sensitivity towards weight changes.

Explicit matrices and vectors are designed to incorporate community structure and enable straightforward maximum likelihood estimation of parameters. We further construct a monitoring statistic based on the generalized likelihood ratio test for change detection of sparse weighted networks.

In addition, we consider reducing the cost of testing a modified or an evolving TFSM specification by the selection of appropriate incremental test suites that can verify whether the modified parts of a modified specification are correctly implemented in a corresponding implementation under test. In particular, we define the incremental testing problem for TFSMs and investigate appropriate fault models that can be used for incremental test derivation and accordingly propose related test selection algorithms. According to conducted experiments length and run time (sum of time delays) of obtained test suites are much lower than their theoretic upper bounds; in some cases, these bounds are linear. In addition, for incremental testing, when the modified part is up to 20% of the whole specification, length and run time of incremental test suites are at least twice as less than those obtained using the whole modified specification."

Requirements analysis methods rely on the expertise and experience of human intervention to make critical judgements. While human judgement is essential to an analysis method, it is also important to ensure a degree of formality so that we reason about safety and security at early stages of analysis and design, rather than detect problems later. In this paper, we present a hierarchical and incremental analysis process that aims to justify the design and flow-down of derived critical requirements arising from safety hazards and security vulnerabilities identified at the system level. The safety and security analysis at each level uses STPA-style action analysis to identify hazards and vulnerabilities. At each level, we verify that the design achieves the safety or security requirements by backing the analysis with formal modelling and proof using Event-B refinement. The formal model helps to identify hazards/vulnerabilities arising from the design and how they relate to the safety accidents/security losses being considered at this level. We then re-apply the same process to each component of the design in a hierarchical manner. Thus, we use hazard and vulnerability analysis, together with refinement-based formal modelling and verification, to drive the design, replacing the system level requirements with component requirements. In doing so, we decompose critical system-level requirements down to component-level requirements, transforming them from abstract system level requirements, towards concrete solutions that we can implement correctly so that the hazards/vulnerabilities are mitigated."

We run two other assessments which show that the obtained results are not due to the size or length of the test suites. In addition, we conduct assessments to determine whether each of the methods has better coverage of certain classes of faults than others and whether the W outperforms the HSI and H methods over only certain classes of faults.

    "abstract": "Digital predistortion (DPD) is the most widely used technique for linearizing power amplifiers. However, the increasing demand for high-bandwidth applications poses a challenge for traditional DPD as it usually entails oversampling a signal by up to five times its bandwidth. To address this, hybrid DPD techniques, which split the predistortion algorithm between the digital and analog domains, offer a promising solution. This study evaluates the robustness of a hybrid digital/analog predistorter in terms of its error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) performances. Specifically, it examines the impacts of a limited gain resolution in the analog predistortion implementation and imperfect delay matching between the input and control signals of the analog predistortion function. These effects were first considered independently of each other. Later, the performance of the linearized amplifier was assessed in presence of both imperfections. The findings show that the ACLR is sensitive to an imperfect implementation of the analog predistortion function. However, the EVM performance is much more resilient to such imperfections."

This paper, focuses on using a combination of computer vision and one of two different misalignment sensors to detect, and further correct lateral misalignment between the EV receiving (Rx) coil and the segmented transmitting (Tx) coils in a charging lane. The vision-based component uses a camera for lane detection and is primarily responsible for detecting larger deviations and making coarse compensations by estimating the lateral shift of the EV, relative to the center of the charging lane. The sensor-based approach relies on Hall effect sensors or detection coils to detect the misalignment in a smaller range, and perform finer corrections. A one-dimensional (1D) actuator moves the receiving coil to correct the coil misalignment, independent of vehicle movements. The vision-based approach showed a wide detection range for misalignment spanning [−15,15] cm, with a correction accuracy of ≈ ±2 cm. This is juxtaposed with the sensor-based approach which operates on a misalignment range of [−3,3] cm, but outperforms the vision-based approach with a correction accuracy of less than ±1 mm. The proposed sensor switching-based approach combines the advantages of the above individual techniques.

The chosen system for this study is a passively-actuated tilted Furuta pendulum, which is known to have a highly nonlinear and coupled model. The pendulum is tilted to ensure the existence of a stable equilibrium configuration for all its degrees of freedom, and the link weights are the only external forces applied to the system. A nonlinear analytical model of the pendulum is derived, and a continuous friction model considering static friction, dynamic friction, viscous friction, and the stribeck effect is selected from the literature. A high-gain Universal Adaptive Stabilizer (UAS) observer is designed to identify friction model parameters using joint angle measurements. The methodology is tested in simulation and validated on an experimental setup. Despite the high nonlinearity of the system, the methodology is proven to converge to the exact parameter values, in simulation, and to yield qualitative parameter magnitudes in experiments where the goodness of fit was around 85% on average. The discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is attributed to the limitations of the friction model. The main advantage of the proposed method is the significant reduction in computational needs and the time required relative to conventional optimization-based identification routines. The proposed approach yielded more than 99% reduction in the estimation time while being considerably more accurate than the optimization approach in every test performed. One more advantage is that the approach can be easily adapted to fit other models to experimental data."

    "abstract": "In Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems-on-chip, processing elements communicate data through a shared memory hierarchy, and a coherent high-performance interconnect, where the de facto standard to handle shared data is through a coherence protocol. Driven by the extraordinary demands from modern real-time embedded system applications to generate, process, and communicate massive amounts of data, recent efforts aim to ensure timing predictability while integrating cache coherence in multi-core real-time systems. However, we observe that most of these efforts compromise system average performance upon offering predictability guarantees. Motivated by this observation, this work proposes an arbiter aimed at providing a predictable, coherent shared cache hierarchy solution, yet with a negligible performance degradation compared to COTS solutions. We achieve this goal by adopting a high-performance-driven architecture including a split-transaction bus and bankized shared cache. In addition, all accesses are arbitrated through a global ordering mechanism. Our proposed arbiter operates alongside conventional coherence protocols without requiring any protocol modifications. Furthermore, we leverage the Duetto reference model by pairing the proposed arbiter and a high-performance arbiter. We evaluate our solution based on both synthetic and SPLASH-3 benchmarks, showing that we can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in predictable cache coherence, while offering a COTS-level performance."

One of the components that can break the system predictability is cache coherence, which ensures the correctness of shared data. This paper proposes a solution towards the enablement of predictable cache coherent real-time systems. The solution uses existing COTS coherence protocols and proposes a methodology to integrate them with legacy real-time arbiters without imposing any required modification to either of them. Doing so, the paper also works as an exploratory study of the integration of various coherence protocols with various predictable arbitration schemes leading to a total of 12 different architecture configurations. Evaluation against four state-of-the-art predictable coherence solutions as well as COTS-based solutions show that the proposed approach achieves the tightest existing latency bounds among predictable solutions with minimal performance degradation over the COTS ones."

Nonetheless, the majority of research in real-time systems either assumes that tasks do not share data or prohibits data sharing by design. Only recently, some works investigated solutions to address this limitation and enable data sharing. However, we find these works to suffer from severe limitations. In particular, proposed predictable cache coherence protocols increase the worst-case memory latency (WCL) quadratically due to coherence interference and breaks compositionality by coupling the design and timing analysis of the coherence with the underlying bus arbitration policy. In this paper, we argue that a protocol that distinguishes between non-modifying (read) and modifying (write) memory accesses is key towards reducing the effects of coherence interference on WCL. Accordingly, we propose DISCO, a discriminative coherence solution that capitalizes on this observation to 1) balance average-case performance and WCL, and 2) more importantly, achieves compositionality in the existing of coherence by enabling the decomposition of the effects from coherence and arbitration components. DISCO achieves 7.2× lower latency bounds compared to the state-of-the-art predictable coherence protocol. DISCO also achieves up to 11.4× (5.3× on average) better performance than private cache bypassing for the SPLASH-3 benchmarks."

Then, the maximum and the sensitivity of the orientation errors have been considered as criteria to compare the precision of the DELTA and the RAF manipulators. The maximum orientation error is determined by solving an optimization problem of the previous analytical model. The sensitivity of the orientation errors is divided into two types: one related to the sensitivity of the orientation errors to the geometric parameters and another one related to the sensitivity of the orientation error to the joint clearances. The results show that the RAF robot precision is more sensitive to the joint clearances than the DELTA one.

This geometric calibration is typically neglected in IR cameras, due to the relatively low resolution of thermal images and the complex IR targets needed for the geometric calibration in comparison to the optical targets. In this study, a thorough literature review of numerous IR camera geometric calibration targets, along with their respective outcomes, were summarized and leveraged to deliver a practical checkerboard target for less experienced end users, while offering the lowest reprojection errors. It was concluded that the fabrication of high emissivity contrast and precise square points of intersection within a checkerboard pattern extends the accuracy of capturing these control points in a thermal image for an optimized IR camera geometric calibration. Accordingly, two simple planar checkerboard targets were fabricated using laser engraving and ultraviolet (UV) printing technologies on a polished stainless steel (SS304) plate. The UV-printed checkerboard target on a polished metallic alloy delivered the lowest mean reprojection error (Formula presented.) of (Formula presented.) pixels and the lowest root mean square error (Formula presented.) of reprojection of (Formula presented.) pixels, with a standard deviation lower than (Formula presented.) pixels. The UV-printed design offers better accuracy than any other checkerboard calibration target, and comparable results to the best prominent circular pattern results reported in the literature."

At the hardware level, we are witnessing increased research efforts to master and improve multicore cache coherence that plays a key role enabling efficient data sharing among threads. Despite these efforts, the limited information provided by performance monitoring counters on cache coherence limits the understanding of coherence's impact on tasks execution time and hence, poses severe constraints to estimate tight worst-case execution time bounds. In this line, this work contributes with an analysis of the impact that cache coherence can have on application timing behavior, and a new set of low-overhead performance monitoring counters that can be used to track the coherence-related contention that different threads can cause on each other when sharing data. Our results show that the proposed performance monitoring counters effectively capture all coherence-related contention that tasks can suffer and hence are key for parallel software timing validation and verification in ECS. Furthermore, they help application optimization by providing key information about data sharing among the application threads."

This is prominent in fields where decisions between subsystems are dependant, as well as in cases where tactical decisions need to be made in uncertain environments. The flexibility gained by incorporating evolutionary design options has been analyzed by discretizing the time-variant uncertainties into scenarios and considering the flexible decision variables in each scenario separately. However, these problems use existing information at the decision time step. This paper presents a dynamic multi-staged design framework to solve problems that dynamically incorporate updated system information and reformulate the problem to account for the updated parameters. The importance of considering staged decisions is studied, and the benefit of the model is evaluated in cases where the stochasticity of the parameters decreases with time. The impact of considering staged deployment for highly stochastic, large-scale systems is investigated through a numerical case study as well as a case study for the IEEE 30 bus system. The case studies presented in this paper investigate multi-disciplinary design problems for large-scale complex systems as well as operational planning for highly stochastic systems.

In this paper, a new hybrid meta-heuristic method based on a Lagrangian relaxation of complicating constraints is introduced to reduce the coupling between disciplines in such systems. The proposed scheme identifies complicating constraints and implements a Lagrangian relaxation scheme that allows the constraint to be decomposed over different subproblems. This reduces the coupling across the disciplines and improves the coordination between them.

    "abstract": "To facilitate the safe adoption of multi-core platforms in real-time systems, a plethora of recent research efforts aim at bounding the delays induced by interference upon accessing the shared memory resources in these platforms. These efforts, despite their value, are scattered, with each one focusing solely on only one of these resources with the premise that latency bounds separately driven for each resource can be added all together to provide a safe end-to-end memory bound. In this work, we put this assumption to the test for the first time by 1) considering a realistic multi-core memory hierarchy system, 2) deriving the bounds for accessing the shared resources in this system, and 3) highlighting the limitations of this widely-adopted approach. In particular, we show that this approach leads to not only excessively pessimistic but also unsafe bounds. Motivated by these findings, we propose GRROF: a novel approach to predictably and efficiently schedule memory requests while traversing the entire memory hierarchy through coordination among arbiters managing all the resources in this hierarchy. By virtue of this novel mechanism, we managed to exploit pipelining upon analyzing the latency of the memory requests for tightly bounding the worst-case latency. We prove in the paper that GRROF enables us to derive a drastically tighter bound compared to the common additive latency approach with more than 18× reduction in the end-to-end memory latency bound for a modern Out-of-Order quad-core platform. The reduction is further improved significantly with the increase in the number of cores. The proposed solution is fully prototyped and tested in a cycle-accurate simulation. We also compare it with real-time competitive state-of-the-art and performance-oriented solutions existing in modern Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) platforms."

By applying a voltage to one arm and setting the other as a ground, the current passes through the electrothermal actuator and induces its displacement along the in-plane direction. The difference in the geometry of the two arms causes one arm to expand more than the other and this results in transverse bending. A computational model was developed using a finite element analysis tool to simulate the response of the thermal actuators with varying geometries and investigate the impact of incorporating perforations on the arms of the thermal actuators to enhance its performance in terms of deflection and operating temperature. The simulation results were compared to their experimental counterparts reported in the literature. A good agreement between the numerical and experimental data was obtained. A novel design of a microgripper, made of perforated electrothermal actuators, was introduced. Its main characteristics, including the tip opening of the gripper arms, the applied voltage, and the stress and temperature distributions, were analyzed using the developed computational model. Different perforation shape and distribution were investigated. The present study demonstrates the capability of perforations to enhance the operation of microgrippers as manifested by the obtained higher tip displacement and lower tip temperature in comparison to conventional microgripper designs made of non-perforated thermal actuators. Furthermore, the highest stress generated on the microgripper elements was found to be much lower than the yield strength of the constituent material, which indicates proper functioning without any mechanical failure."

This stems from the fact that current MPSoCs barely provide any event monitors on how tasks interact and delay each other in memory. Besides, even if hardware and software mechanisms are in place to mitigate contention in the memory system, it is hard - if at all possible - to provide evidence about their correctness. In this work, we cover this gap by proposing a lightweight hardware mechanism that tightly tracks inter-core contention in memory. The proposed hardware mechanism, which we evaluate in detail, improves the quality of timing-related evidence that must be provided on how contention in main memory of multicore real-time systems is handled in adherence to applicable safety standards."

The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is examined to estimate the system's state under model uncertainty. Its combination with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to acquire better navigational accuracy while being robust to the system's modeling uncertainty is investigated. The proposed hybrid method is compared with the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the UKF, and the SVSF. The proposed algorithms fuse an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) measurements to obtain the vehicle's state. Experimental results are compared to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution. It is shown that all filtering strategies have similar performance in the absence of large-magnitude noise and model uncertainties. When injecting modeling uncertainties, the performance of the UKF degrades, and that of the EKF goes out of bounds. On the other hand, increasing the covariances of the measurement and dynamics noise sequences causes the path of the SVSF to become nonsmooth and roughly oscillates around the true path. The proposed integrated UK-SVSF algorithm achieves the following objectives: first, using the Kaman-based filter enhances the optimality of the filter to GPS/IMU dynamics and measurements noise. Second, using the UKF reduces the estimation error by eliminating the first-order linearization step. Finally, using the SVSF enhances the estimate's robustness to model uncertainty. Results reveal that, in the presence of both large-magnitude noise and model uncertainties, the UK-SVSF gives an enhanced estimation performance."

This work is a step towards facilitating high-performance and coherent data sharing in real-time systems by tackling two main problems. The first is a well-acknowledged one: shared caches render cache analysis techniques useless and all cache accesses have to be assumed misses. The second is a new one, where we show that coherence interference voids classical cache analysis techniques. We contribute a solution that tackles both problems by leveraging time-based cache coherence and a novel methodology to integrate its effect into cache analysis. Thanks to this solution, we enable the usage of shared memory hierarchy with coherent shared data, while we prove that we are able to restore cache analysis; and hence, provide much tighter memory latency bounds."

    "title": "Event Monitor Validation in High-Integrity Systems — Mohamed Hassan",
    "abstract": "Platforms for modern embedded systems equip an increasing number of high-performance features to provide the required levels of performance. Timing analysis solutions handle the complexity of these platforms by relying on hardware event monitors (HEMs) that provide insightful information about resource utilization and, hence, contention among tasks. As a result, HEMs have become a key element to warrant a safe timing behavior of a system, for which reason they must be validated. While some initial works target HEMs validation, they consider one HEM at a time and focus on those HEMs for which an expert can establish an expected value for relatively small code snippets. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the validation of those HEMs for which a specific expected value cannot be established a priori even for simple cases and, instead, needs to be validated in conjunction with other HEMs. Our method also deals with the natural variability of the HEMs' values in high-performance platforms when collected in different experiments. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique for validating HEMs related to cache coherence in a relevant platform in the avionics domain."

The conditioned approach ensures that the control input stays within bounds, the adaptive barrier adjusts the sliding mode controller (SMC) gains, and the super-twisting technique helps in reducing the chattering. Consequently, the overall system performance is improved. The HESS consists of a fuel cell, battery, and super-capacitor. A rule-based energy management system has been designed, defining different modes of operation for an efficient use of energy sources under different loading conditions. The designed energy management system accounts for the power inflow and the status of the energy sources. The proposed controller ensures smooth energy sources current tracking and stabilizes the DC bus voltage while controlling the motor speed and flux under various operating conditions. The controller's global asymptotic stability has been verified through Lyapunov stability analysis. Intensive computer simulations using Matlab/Simulink are performed to validate the proposed controller's performance and compare it with the conventional PI and SMC controllers.

We introduce a novel optimization technique based on the Riemannian manifolds that jointly optimizes the BS beamformer and the radar transmit waveform covariance matrix to maximize the communication system sum rate (SR). This is done while reducing the interference levels affecting the radar and keeping its performance close to its standalone one. Specifically, we employ the complex cone and the spectrahedron manifolds as search spaces for the beamforming and the radar transmit waveform covariance matrix, respectively. In addition and for comparison purposes, we solve the same problem using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the non-convex problem over Euclidean manifolds. Simulation results indicate that the proposed manifold-based optimization algorithm provides a substantial improvement in the SR, and a notable reduction in the algorithm complexity when compared to the traditional SDP method. These benefits highlight its efficiency and potential for practical implementation in spectrum-sharing scenarios."

One of the challenges facing RCC, however, is the mutual interference between the two coexisting subsystems. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can thus be used to address such a challenge by optimizing its phase shifts along with the beamforming weights at the base station (BS). In this article, we aim to maximize the communication sum rate (SR), while limiting the interference toward the radar to a certain limit. Motivated by the unexplored fact that covariance matrices of RCC signals are Hermitian positive definite (HPD) and hence, can be represented over Riemannian manifolds (i.e., curved surfaces), the RCC SR maximization problem is reformulated as minimization of a Riemannian metric, which is the geodesic distance between the covariance matrices of the radar and the RIS-relayed signals. Such geometric reformulation paves the road for a low-complexity optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds, which simultaneously optimizes the beamforming weights and phase shifts at the BS and RIS, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly increases the communication SR, while meeting the constraint on the interference toward radar. Equally important, the proposed optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds exhibits a reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms over Euclidean spaces."

Mangroves in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries of the Arabian peninsula (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have faced pressure from numerous anthropogenic factors including population growth, dredging and reclamation in lagoonal habitats, pollution and rapid urban development. Given the inconsistent outcomes of past mangrove ARR (Afforestation-Reforestation-Revegetation) efforts, our research aimed to identify high-potential ARR sites in the GCC using remote sensing. We identified eight factors related to mangrove ARR outcomes through correlation analyses: elevation, soil pH, median precipitation, median and minimum land surface temperature (LST), soil salinity, soil texture and distance from urban areas. To predict mangrove suitability, we compared the Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classification algorithms. The RF model performed best with an F1-score of 0.96, ROC-AUC of 0.99 and PR-AUC of 0.75. Variable importance analysis revealed that median LST, soil texture and median precipitation were the most influential variables. Favorable conditions for mangrove establishment included median temperatures of 32–37 °C, minimum temperatures around 27 °C, clayey soils, and monthly rainfall above 10 mm. Other suitable characteristics included lower elevation, greater distance from urban areas, slightly acidic to neutral pH, and moderate-to-high soil salinity. Our findings show that there is a large opportunity for mangrove afforestation in the GCC and also proposes a framework to identify optimal sites for mangrove growth, which can improve ARR success and support biodiversity and blue carbon goals in the Arabian peninsula."

To estimate ENLspan, a theoretical model has been proposed. The results showed that ENLspan ranges in [1,3] depending on the media's scattering property. Results demonstrated also that the use of the eigenvalues produced better estimation of ENLspan than the use of diagonal elements of the coherence or the covariance matrix. The proposed model produced also a more accurate estimation of ENLspan than the one obtained by the direct calculation.

To surmount this limitation, by exploiting the ergodicity of the SAR data, the multilooking is substituted by the spatial averaging of N homogenous neighboring pixels. In this letter, it has been demonstrated that the multilooking and spatial averaging are quite different. First, the spatial averaging introduced a correlation between the pixels whereas in the multilooking they remain independent. Secondly, in real scene, the spatial averaging estimation of the polarimetric parameters (i.e. intensity mean and variance, equivalent number of looks (ENL), entropy and alpha angle) is nosier and more biased than the multilooked ones.

In PolSAR filtering, the weight coefficient b is estimated from the span image. However, it has been demonstrated that the standard deviation of the span (i. e. sigma-{v(span)}) is a pixel dependent.

This study introduces a time segmentation and frequency windowing-based novel strategy for cross-terms free WVD of multicomponent nonstationary signals.

The proposed time-frequency representation (TFR) is also applied for HAR from the received signals of frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. A novel analysis of extracting slow-time signatures from the received signal captured by FMCW radar is developed and the proposed technique is utilized to generate cross-term free TFRs from these signatures for each activity. Threshold-based time windowing followed by 2-D segmented features extraction is performed on the TFRs for activity recognition system development.

Remote sensing tools can be used to monitor mangroves, measure mangrove forest-and-tree-level attributes and vegetation indices at different spatial and temporal scales that allow a detailed and comprehensive understanding of these important ecosystems. Using a systematic literature approach, we reviewed 58 remote sensing-based mangrove assessment articles published from 2010 through 2022. The main objectives of the study were to examine the extent of mangrove distribution and cover, and the remotely sensed data sources used to assess mangrove forest/tree attributes. The key importance of and threats to mangroves that were specific to the region were also examined. Mangrove distribution and cover were mainly estimated from satellite images (75.2%), using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from Landsat (73.3%), IKONOS (15%), Sentinel (11.7%), WorldView (10%), QuickBird (8.3%), SPOT-5 (6.7%), MODIS (5%) and others (5%) such as PlanetScope. Remotely sensed data from aerial photographs/images (6.7%), LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) (5%) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)/Drones (3.3%) were the least used. Mangrove cover decreased in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait between 1996 and 2020. However, mangrove cover increased appreciably in Qatar and remained relatively stable for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the same period, which was attributed to government conservation initiatives toward expanding mangrove afforestation and restoration through direct seeding and seedling planting. The reported country-level mangrove distribution and cover change results varied between studies due to the lack of a standardized methodology, differences in satellite imagery resolution and classification approaches used. There is a need for UAV-LiDAR ground truthing to validate country-and-local-level satellite data. Urban development-driven coastal land reclamation and pollution, climate change-driven temperature and sea level rise, drought and hypersalinity from extreme evaporation are serious threats to mangrove ecosystems. Thus, we encourage the prioritization of mangrove conservation and restoration schemes to support the achievement of related UN Sustainable Development Goals (13 climate action, 14 life below water, and 15 life on land) in the GCC countries."

The main objectives of this study were to develop a mangrove forest regeneration age map that represents the age of all the existing secondary mangroves in the past 37 years (1986–2023). Long-term Landsat satellite imagery, the random forest classification algorithm, and logistic regression analyses were used to identify the existing secondary mangroves and determine the underlying drivers that contribute to the successful afforestation of mangroves in the region. Our results showed that only around 8.5% of secondary mangrove forests in the GCC region were older than 30 years, with mangroves younger than 5 years being the most abundant age class (41.3%). Saudi Arabia and Oman have the highest percentages of young mangroves, while relatively older secondary mangrove forests were most common in Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE.

The results of the stepwise logistic regression show that the main drivers that influence mangrove regeneration are lower elevation, lower slope, higher available soil moisture, lower average temperatures, higher precipitation, greater proximity to freshwater sources, lower population density and greater distance from agricultural and urban areas. Our results aim to offer support to decision-making in selecting optimal areas for new planting initiatives in the region."

    "title": "Current Status of Remote Sensing for Studying the Impacts of Hurricanes on Mangrove Forests in the Coastal United States — Tarig Ali",
    "abstract": "Hurricane incidents have become increasingly frequent along the coastal United States and have had a negative impact on the mangrove forests and their ecosystem services across the southeastern region. Mangroves play a key role in providing coastal protection during hurricanes by attenuating storm surges and reducing erosion. However, their resilience is being increasingly compromised due to climate change through sea level rises and the greater intensity of storms. This article examines the role of remote sensing tools in studying the impacts of hurricanes on mangrove forests in the coastal United States. Our results show that various remote sensing tools including satellite imagery, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used to detect mangrove damage, monitor their recovery and analyze their 3D structural changes. Landsat 8 OLI (14%) has been particularly useful in long-term assessments, followed by Landsat 5 TM (9%) and NASA G-LiHT LiDAR (8%). Random forest (24%) and linear regression (24%) models were the most common modeling techniques, with the former being the most frequently used method for classifying satellite images. Some studies have shown significant mangrove canopy loss after major hurricanes, and damage was seen to vary spatially based on factors such as proximity to oceans, elevation and canopy structure, with taller mangroves typically experiencing greater damage. Recovery rates after hurricane-induced damage also vary, as some areas were seen to show rapid regrowth within months while others remained impacted after many years. The current challenges include capturing fine-scale changes owing to the dearth of remote sensing data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This review provides insights into the current remote sensing applications used in hurricane-prone mangrove habitats and is intended to guide future research directions, inform coastal management strategies and support conservation efforts."

The proposed model employs the Variational Bayesian Maximum Correntropy Cubature Kalman Filter (VBMCCKF) to achieve high-accuracy capacity estimation. By using a variational Bayesian approach, the filter effectively adapts to uncertainties in measurement noise, while the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) handles outliers. Additionally, a new model correlating capacity with internal cell resistance is introduced to further enhance estimation. The VBMCCKF’s performance was compared against the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), and Variational Bayesian CKF (VBCKF). Using the NASA dataset, which includes four batteries with varying initial conditions (ICs), the VBMCCKF consistently outperformed these algorithms. Notably, the filter achieved an average performance improvements ranging from 35% to over 200%, depending on the presence of outliers and the battery ICs. The VBMCCKF shows significant promise in improving the reliability of battery management systems (BMSs), optimizing battery usage, and enhancing the safety and durability of battery systems."

Although current detection methods, such as PCR and ELISA, are considerably sensitive, they are often time-consuming and expensive, which limits their use in point-of-care applications. Recently, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have attracted high interest as biosensors for the detection of viruses given their unique structure and chemical properties. Herein, we investigate the use of MIL-100(Fe) as a biosensing system for the fluorescent detection of HIV RNA sequences. The MOF is characterized to explore its structural and morphological properties using XRD, FT-IR, BET, TGA, and FE-SEM. The fluorescence quenching ability of MIL-100(Fe) toward P-DNA was first investigated. The experimental results revealed a high quenching efficiency of 98.02 % through mechanisms like π-π stacking and electron transfer. The experiments indicated a static quenching process, where PET exhibited greater effect over FRET in the quenching mechanism. The system also exhibited excellent sensitivity, with an ultra-low LOD of 5.87 pM and an incubation time of 30 min. Furthermore, the selectivity of the biosensor was confirmed using RNA sequences with one-base and two-base mismatches. These results demonstrate the capability of MIL-100(Fe) as a fast and highly sensitive biosensor for HIV RNA detection, offering promise for future point-of-care applications. In sum, our newly developed biosensor is a potential diagnostic tool for the reliable and accurate detection of HIV, and it may be implicated in the prevention of HIV infection and enhanced treatment/management options for HIV infected individuals and AIDS patients."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we design, develop, and analyse silicon micropillars coated with NH<inf>2</inf>-MIL-125(Ti) metal-organic framework (MOF) for detecting low concentrations of diclofenac (DCF). The micropillars are etched on silicon wafers using UV lithography and a drop coating technique to fabricate a novel optical sensor. These micropillars can serve as sensing platforms for the detection of micropollutants. FESEM analysis confirmed the MOF coating on the silicon micropillars, indicating a strong interaction between the MOF and the silicon substrate. Furthermore, the deposition process was assessed by estimating the coverage area of the NH<inf>2</inf>-MIL-125(Ti) MOF on the silicon micropillars. Additionally, fluorescence microscopic images showed that the presence of DCF in the NH<inf>2</inf>-MIL-125(Ti) MOF produced significantly brighter fluorescence compared to the MOF alone. The MOF-based sensor exhibits exceptional selectivity in detecting DCF molecules via a fluorescence “turn-on” mechanism, achieving a low limit of detection of 0.07 μM across a broad linear range from 0.11 μM - 0.52 μM with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.989. Furthermore, the study revealed that the observed turn-on phenomenon is associated with the absorbance-caused enhancement mechanism (ACE) and electron transfer processes. Additionally, to validate the sensor's real-world applicability, agricultural runoff samples were tested using the developed platform, confirming its effectiveness in complex environmental matrices. Through a cost-effective and eco-friendly technique, the MOF-based sensor demonstrates improved selectivity and specificity. This work marks a significant advancement in optical sensors, offering an effective solution for detecting pharmaceutical contaminants in environmental waters. Environmental implications: The NH<inf>2</inf>-MIL-125(Ti) MOF-coated silicon micropillars offer a highly sensitive and selective approach for detecting diclofenac (DCF), a pharmaceutical pollutant threatening aquatic ecosystems. This fluorescence-based sensor enables real-time, cost-effective water quality monitoring, reducing reliance on complex analytical techniques. Its eco-friendly fabrication minimizes secondary pollution, making it a sustainable alternative for environmental sensing.

All together, they provide elasticity and skin-conformability. Glycerol was added in this work as it also acts as an ionic conductor and a plasticizer, thus, improving interfacial charge transfer and electrode hydration stability. The composite was fabricated by an easy polymerization and curing process. The morphological, electrochemical, and mechanical characteristics of the fabricated electrode were evaluated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed low impedance, high conductivity, and stability. The electrochemical characteristics demonstrated the lowest bulk resistance of 0.658 kΩ, a conductivity of 0.0193 S m<sup>−1</sup> and a charge storage capacity of 4.626 mC m<sup>−2</sup>. The ductile properties for the samples showed a low elastic Young modulus of 10.3 ± 5.4 kPa. Electroencephalograph (ECG) signal was recorded at a considerable good quality with SNR of 33.31 dB.

In this paper, an agent-based architecture for precision agriculture (PA) is presented. Unlike traditional approaches, entities are modeled as autonomous agents that can collaborate to monitor soil, crops and climate in an agricultural field and hence provide timely decisions to facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real time. An important issue within the PA environment is the heterogeneity and the diversity of the data. The data is collected from distributed heterogeneous devices and sensors that are interconnected through the Internet. These issues lead to the lack of the interoperability and thus make the task of processing, analyzing and interpreting of PA data, a challenging task.

    "abstract": "Manufacturers of smart home consumer devices like home theatres, music players, voice-based assistants, smart lighting, and security cameras have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices pose a significant security risk to consumers because the devices are exposed to mobile applications and cloud-based services with known security vulnerabilities. Most current home consumer devices provide little or no information about the level of security they afford. Since most consumers are not tech-savvy, it is currently difficult for a consumer to make an informed decision about which consumer device model (e.g., smart television model) has the best security. Hence, consumers need an objective security ranking of each type (e.g., security cameras) of home consumer devices. This paper proposes a novel methodology to systematically build such security rankings for home consumer devices. The proposed methodology can be applied by utilizing data from any security assessment study. The paper discusses previous efforts in applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank security risks in general. The paper also presents a systematic survey of security vulnerabilities of smart home consumer devices when viewed from an IoT lens. Using the proposed methodology, a case study, employing an AHP model for ranking commonly used home consumer devices including home theatres, security cameras, smart lighting, smart speakers, video surveillance, smart switches, home automation systems, home security systems, smart routers, wireless doorbell cameras, and home audio systems, was developed. Relative security rankings for each type of consumer device were derived from the AHP model. According to the AHP model, network security was the primary driver of smart home device security with a priority of 0.6893 while application security had the least priority of 0.0591. Critical Vulnerabilities were the most important for device security (priority=0.4397), Man-in-The-Middle attacks for network security (priority=0.2019), exploitable services for cloud security (priority=0.26), and sensitive data for application security (0.7626). The AHP model was internally consistent (Consistency Ratio < 0.1). Sensitivity analysis showed that the AHP model was robust against pairing assumptions."

We propose an enhanced real-time single-sensor home appliance classification and monitoring system leveraging convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. The real-time information obtained from smart meters is input into a pre-trained learning model which classifies multiple concurrently active home appliances. The convolutional neural network architectures of VGG16, ResNet50, and the InceptionV3 are trained individually by the transfer-learning paradigm with the image features of V-I trajectories, spectrograms, continuous wavelet transforms, and Fryze decomposed active components respectively. This approach effectively realizes end-to-end learning, and mitigates the need to disaggregate load before the identification process. Experimental results suggest that the utilization of transfer learning improves the multi-label classification performance of aggregate load. This model is made accessible to consumers through a mobile application, which is used to interface with smart meter data and provide subsequent appliance usage insights. This is one of of the first works to re-purpose pre-trained deep learning networks used for image processing high frequency concurrent load classification in the context of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)."

Conversely, the chemical components of these solvents: salicylic acid, trihexylamine, and trioctylamine showed minimal effects when tested individually. These results are very promising and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time on the effects of deep eutectic solvents on amoebae. These results can be applied in the development of new formulations of novel contact lens disinfectants against Acanthamoeba castellanii."

Several lines of evidence suggest inadequate contact lens solutions especially against the cyst forms of pathogenic Acanthamoeba, indicating the need to develop effective disinfectants. Objective: In this work, the application and assessment of montmorillonite clay (Mt-clay), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and cetylpyridinium chloride-montmorillonite clay complex (CPC-Mt) against keratitis-causing A. castellanii belonging to the T4 genotype was studied. Methods: Adhesion to human cells and amoeba-mediated cytopathogenicity assays were conducted to determine the impact of Mt-clay, CPC and CPC-Mt complex on amoeba-mediated binding and host cell death. Furthermore, assays were also performed to determine inhibitory effects of Mt-clay, CPC and CPC-Mt complex on encystment and excystment. In addition, the cytotoxicity of Mt-clay, CPC and CPC-Mt complex against human cells was examined. Results: The results revealed that CPC and CPC-Mt complex presented significant antiamoebic effects against A. castellanii at microgram dose. Also, the CPC and CPC-Mt complex inhibited amoebae binding to host cells. Furthermore, CPC and CPC-Mt complex, were found to inhibit the encystment and excystment processes. Finally, CPC and CPC-Mt complex showed minimal host cell cytotoxicity. These results show that CPC and CPC-Mt complex exhibit potent anti-acanthamoebic properties. Conclusion: Given the ease of usage, safety, cost-effectiveness and long-term stability, CPC and CPC-Mt complex can prove to be an excellent choice in the rational development of contact-lens disinfectants to eradicate pathogenic Acanthamoeba effectively."

Microbial-based technologies produce electricity by utilizing the organic waste found in wastewater as a substrate through a microbial catalyzed electrochemical reaction. This creates a potential gradient between the anode and the cathode that stimulates the ions’ transfer through an ion-exchange membrane. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) works in the same principle of MDC. Unlike the conventional MFC, it lacks a terminal acceptor of the electrons that results in the production of hydrogen at the cathode compartment. This chapter discussed the current progress of MDC in terms of treating different types of wastewater, while desalinating seawater, removing different pollutants, and generating electricity. Moreover, it provided the available integrated technologies for the production of biohydrogen, biomethane, and other fuels using a MEC. In addition, current challenges from these technologies were highlighted. Finally, it provided an effective future perspective for overcoming these challenges and paths for success."

They can possess cancer cell-specific cytotoxic effects themselves, carry drugs or enzymes that can produce cytotoxic effects, improve imaging modalities, and target tumor cells over normal cells. Hybrid nanogels bring together a wide range of desirable properties for cancer treatment such as stimuli-responsiveness, efficient loading and protection of molecules such as drugs or enzymes, and effective crossing of cellular barriers among other properties. Despite their promising abilities, hybrid nanogels are still far from being used in the clinic, and their available data remains relatively limited. However, many studies can be done to facilitate this clinical transition. This review is critically summarizing and analyzing the recent information and progress on the use of hybrid nanogels particularly inorganic nanoparticle-based and organic nanoparticle-based hybrid nanogels in the field of oncology and future directions to aid in transferring those results to the clinic. This work concludes that the future of hybrid nanogels is greatly impacted by therapeutic and non-therapeutic factors. Therapeutic factors include the lack of hemocompatibility studies, acute and chronic toxicological studies, and information on agglomeration capability and extent, tumor heterogeneity, interaction with proteins in physiological fluids, endocytosis-exocytosis, and toxicity of the nanogels' breakdown products. Non-therapeutic factors include the lack of clear regulatory guidelines and standardized assays, limitations of animal models, and difficulties associated with good manufacture practices (GMP)."

Despite running on an extremely limited computation, power and memory budget, the proposed solution achieves comparable results to server-based state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, it meets the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard for grade B (C in extremely-constrained devices). This is achieved by careful investigation of the correlation between a wide-set of ECG and PPG features and BP. Afterwards, we compress the ML inference models by only incorporating the minimal features that meet i) the edge constraints from one side, and ii) the standard's acceptable accuracy from the other side. Unlike existing solutions, the inference is entirely conducted on MCU-based edge devices without depending on any cloud-based infrastructure.

Positive rheotaxis (PR) is the tendency of sperm cells to swim against the flow. Herein, we describe sperm rheotaxis in fertile and infertile males, using a microfluidic platform and focus on rheotaxis as a potential marker of male fertility. A previously reported computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) plugin for Image-J was used to detect and analyze the motion of human sperm cells in microfluidic environments. The fabricated microchannels mimic the female reproductive tracts and use an image-processing program to monitor sperm swimming behavior in semen samples from fertile and infertile men. We have constructed an image-processing pipeline. The image-processing pipeline incorporated strengthens object detection and particle tracking to adapt to sperm that are out of focus while swimming on the same track. PR% was defined as the number of PR sperm cells over the number of motile sperm cells. The results showed that the percentage of PR correlates with fertility, wherein the fertile male specimens showed a higher PR% than the other groups (P < 0.05). There is no difference in progressive motility between the control group (fertile men with normal sperm analysis) and group 1 (G1; infertile men with normal sperm analysis). However, PR% was lower (P < 0.05) in the G1 group (13.5 ± 0.4%) compared to the control group (40.3 ± 3.3%) and group 2 (G2; infertile with reduced sperm motility) (15.3 ± 4.6%). Thus, PR% may be used as a novel parameter to explain infertility even in situations where basic sperm analysis following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines is unable to do so. We propose to use PR% as a novel parameter for sperm analysis and as a method of sperm selection in assisted reproductive technology."

In order to predict the performance of biofilters, mathematical models under steady-state and transient conditions are needed. The transient biofilter models for gas-phase bioreactors are highly complex, as they involve several parameters that are not easily determined for industrial applications. In this work, a practical transient biofilter model is developed and an analytical solution for the transient model is obtained. When this model is compared with the published but more complex model, this new transient model produces almost the same level of prediction with equal comparisons of experimental data for VOCs, benzene, and toluene. This simple model has fewer parameters and will be very useful and practical for industrial applications for the analysis of transient biofilter performance."

Photoplethysmography (PPG), a low-cost optical pulse wave technology, is one method with this potential. PPG signals come from changes in the amount of blood in the microvascular bed of tissue. Therefore, these signals can be used to figure out anomalies within the cardiovascular system. This work shows how to use PPG signals and feature selection-based classifiers to identify cardiorespiratory disorders based on the extraction of time-domain features. Data were collected from 360 healthy and cardiovascular disease patients. For analysis and identification, five types of cardiovascular disorders were considered. The categories of cardiovascular diseases were identified using a two-stage classification process. The first stage was utilized to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy subjects. Subjects who were found to be abnormal were then entered into the second stage classifier, which was used to determine the type of the disease. Seven different classifiers were employed to classify the dataset. Based on the subset of features found by the classifier, the Naïve Bayes classifier obtained the best test accuracy, with 94.44% for the first stage and 89.37% for the second stage. The results of this study show how vital the PPG signal is. Many time-domain parts of the PPG signal can be easily extracted and analyzed to find out if there are problems with the heart. The results were accurate and precise enough that they did not need to be looked at or analyzed further. The PPG classifier built on a simple microcontroller will work better than more expensive ones and will not make the patient nervous."

Results: In a 2 h incubation period, DES-B, DES-C, DES-D, and DES-E exhibited up to 85 % amoebicidal activity at micromolar doses, which was enhanced further following 24 h incubation.

Using lactate dehydrogenase assays, DES were evaluated for their cytopathic effects towards human cells. Results from antibacterial tests revealed that DES prepared from the combination of methyl-trioctylammonium chloride and glycerol (DES-4) and DES prepared form methyl-trioctylammonium chloride and fructose (DES-11) at a 2 µL dose showed broad-spectrum antibacterial behavior and had the highest bactericidal activity. Moreover, DES-4 showed 40% and 68% antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and E. coli K1, respectively. Similarly, DES-11 eliminated 65% and 61% E. coli K1 and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Among Gram-positive bacteria, DES-4 showed important antibacterial activity, inhibiting 75% of B. cereus and 51% of S. pneumoniae. Likewise, DES-11 depicted 70% B. cereus and 50% S. pneumoniae bactericidal effects. Finally, the DES showed limited cytotoxic properties against human cell lines with the exception of the DES prepared from Methyltrioctylammonium chloride and Citric acid (DES-10), which had 88% cytotoxic effects. These findings suggest that DES depict potent antibacterial efficacies and cause minimal damage to human cells. It can be concluded that the selected DES in this study could be utilized as valuable and novel antibacterial drugs against bacterial infections.

    "abstract": "Oxygen is vital for cellular energetics and metabolism in the human body. Blood transports oxygen to the tissues with hemoglobin in red blood cells playing a key role in the transportation of oxygen. To account for the Fåhraeus and Fåhraeus–Lindqvist effects, we use Haynes marginal zone concept, which subdivides each microvessel into a cell free layer surrounding a core region of uniform red blood cells concentration. The marginal zone concept is used to develop a steady state model for the transport of oxygen from blood to tissue where chemical reaction of oxygen occurs to produce energy. The approach is based on fundamentals of fluid flow and mass transfer in the two zones while accounting for the role of hemoglobin in the transport process and including mass transfer and chemical reaction in the tissue to produce energy using the Krogh cylinder concept. In contrast to transport modeling of solutes such as glucose, the present model includes the key role of hemoglobin in the transport of oxygen from blood to tissue. The model is analytical and provides analytical expressions for the oxygen level profiles in the blood cell free layer, the core zone, and the Krogh cylinder. The results are found to agree with published results in the literature for oxygen transport from blood in capillary size microvessel to its Krogh tissue cylinder.

Electrically stimulating the denervated muscles using implantable electrodes is emerging as a promising potential strategy to prevent muscle atrophy during the nerve regeneration period. So far, conventional implantable electrodes utilized metals for their high conductivity and corrosion resistance. Recent studies replaced metals with flexible conductive polymers to evade the mechanical mismatch of biological tissues with the rigid metals. However, conductive polymers are also restricted by their cost and hazardous nature. Therefore, there is still a need for novel conductive, flexible, low cost, and safe implantable electrodes for potential prevention of muscle atrophy in peripheral nerve injury patients. This work reports the development of a novel low cost, conductive, and flexible implantable electrode composed of the biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (base) and boronic-acid modified carbon dots (filler). In this study, electrical properties and electrochemical stability of the electrodes were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Electrodes prepared in this work with low boronic-acid carbon dot (BA-CDs) percentages possessed impedances as low as 123 Ω with a conductivity of 1.04×10-3 S/cm, and were electrochemically stable and capable of storing charge. The obtained electrical properties are comparable to those of other PDMS-based electrodes as well as other implantable electrode materials despite using only 10% of the BA-CDs.

Towards this target, continuous BP monitoring is a must. Unfortunately, such continuous monitoring is hindered by the inconvenience of the traditional cuff-based method. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a promising alternative to address such problems. Nonetheless, existing CNN-based solutions rely on server-like infrastructure with huge computation and memory capabilities. This entails these solutions impractical with several security, privacy, reliability, and latency concerns. The contribution of this paper is twofold as follows. First, the paper contributes to the general field of tinyML by proposing novel techniques that enable the fitting of popular CNNs into extremely-constrained edge devices with limited computation, memory, and power budget. Namely, the paper successfully manages to fit the following five popular CNNs into tiny edge devices: AlexNet, LeNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet, and MobileNet. This enables us to run inference completely on the edge without dependency on connectivity or cloud infrastructure. The proposed techniques use a combination of novel architecture modifications, pruning, and quantization methods. Second, utilizing this stepping stone, the paper proposes a tinyML-based solution to enable accurate and continuous BP estimation using only photo-plethysmogram (PPG) signals. We conduct an extensive evaluation using thousands of real Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient data and several tiny edge devices and all the five aforementioned CNNs. Results show that the proposed solutions offer comparable accuracy to server-based solutions, and also meet the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards."

The existing metallic made bioelectrodes exhibit extremely high electrochemical resistances that would interfere with the neural-electrode bridge and suffer from mechanical and immunological mismatch. Novel, flexible, implantable bioelectrodes based on MXenes (Ti3C2) and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite are proposed. Mxenes possess the advantage of having metallic ultra-conductive transition metals consisting of large groups of carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides, while PDMS has inherent biostability, flexibility and biocompatibility. In the current research, PDMS has been used as the supporting matrix for conductive fillers such as PMMA, PEDOT, and Mxenes. A series of characterization techniques were performed such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and mechanical testing. The average results of triplicate samples exhibited samples' bulk impedance of 0.913 kΩ, an impedance of 1.612 MΩ, at 1 kHz frequency and a conductivity of 1.41x10-4S/cm, charge storage capacity of 0.056 mC/cm2 and Young's modulus of 3.81 MPa."

    "abstract": "Noble metals are the main materials used for implantable electrodes due to their high conductivity and stability. However, metals' harshness to biological tissues restricts their use for implantation purposes. Hence, alternative flexible, conductive, and stable materials are being explored to replace metal electrodes. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a polymer long considered suitable for implantation due to its biocompatibility and ability to withstand long implantation periods without deteriorating. However, PDMS lacks the electrical conductivity required of electrode materials. Therefore, PDMS has been doped with a range of conductive fillers to yield a conductive and elastic electrode composite. In this study, boronic acid-modified carbon dots (BA-CDs) are explored for the first time as conductive PDMS fillers to develop a conductive yet flexible PDMS-based electrode material. Electrodes composed of 25% BA-CDs, 16% glycerol (dispersant), and 59% PDMS were prepared and evaluated for their bulk impedance, conductivity, electrochemical stability, and charge storage capacity using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and elasticity, using Young's modulus obtained from uniaxial tensile testing. Results of this study revealed relatively high conductivity of the electrode (6.93×10-4S/cm) with low bulk impedance (185 Ω), which is comparable to that of some PDMS-based electrodes in the literature. The electrode was also electrochemically stable and capable of charge storage. Mechanically, the electrodes possessed a Young's modulus of 0.1691 MPa that is mechanically compatible with biological tissue. Results presented in this study show encouraging electrical and mechanical characteristics and provide a foundation for future studies to transition this composite for implantable electrode applications such as electrical stimulation of muscles suffering from peripheral nerve injuries."

A 90% increase in world research in the biogas industry over the past 10 years, as reported in 2021, stresses the growing captivation among researchers. Although lab-scale analysis with well-defined conditions is widely available in the literature, full-scale studies on anaerobic digestion plants are limited in comparison. Three published case studies on full-scale working plants are analyzed, and some unique observations, differing from published literature at times, are observed. The first case study on a plant using a substrate with high substrate variability confirmed that increasing the organic loading rate of biomass produced an increase in the ratio of volatile fatty acids to alkalinity (VFA/TAC) that resulted in reduced operation stability. Results of the second case study, using a substrate containing a high concentration of inhibitory molecules, demonstrated that decreasing the biomass flow rate increases the biogas production, reduction in total volatile solids is more pronounced for purer substrates dictating an effective biomass conversion, and inhibitory molecules did not impact biomass conversion because of excellent process design coupled with high heat exchange efficiency and increased homogenization of the substrate. In the final case study, foaming and overacidification were analyzed. While the study did not manage to confirm early warning signs for foaming, VFA/Ca, VFA/Mg, VFA/P, and VFA/S were proposed as early warning indicators for overacidification. Finally, some published indicators for overacidification, such as EWI-PO4/Ca, EWI-PO4, propionic/acetic acid, TOC/TN, and, in cases of high cattle rumen, the occurrence of high potassium levels and low sodium levels, were not deemed applicable in this study."

They can be used for neural signal recording and for electrical stimulation of atrophying muscles. Unlike the traditionally used metal electrodes that are harsh to the body's tissues, flexible electrodes conduct electricity while preserving the delicate tissues. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a non-conductive synthetic polymer characterized by its flexibility, low cost, biocompatibility, and durability during implantation, has been explored as a matrix for flexible electrodes. This study reports the synthesis of composite boronic acid-modified carbon dots (BA-CDs)/PDMS electrode materials. The performance of the composite electrode is evaluated electrochemically (for its conductivity and charge storage capacity) and mechanically (Young's modulus). Furthermore, the effect of increasing the PDMS crosslinking density on the electrode's performance is studied based on the hypothesis that a higher crosslinking will bring the BA-CDs closer together, thereby facilitating the movement of electrons. Results of this study showed that incorporating 10% BA-CDs dispersed with 16% glycerol in 74% PDMS with a higher crosslinking density resulted in a bulk impedance of 47.7 Ω and a conductivity of 2.68×10-3 S/cm, both of which surpassed that of the same composition with lower crosslinking. The synthesized flexible electrode material was capable of charge storage although the charge storage capacity (0.00365 mC/cm2) was lower than the safe limit for some tissue activation. Furthermore, the electrode maintained a modulus of elasticity (0.2322 MPa) that is compatible with biological soft tissues.Clinical Relevance - This study reports a conductive electrode that has a flexibility compatible with that of biological tissues for future purposes such as neural signal recording and tissue electrical stimulation (e.g. atrophying muscles). The reported BA-CD/PDMS electrode overcomes the limitations of the harsh metals previously used as implantable electrodes that harm the biological tissues due to their high rigidity"

Their exceptional characteristics including biocompatibility, biodegradability, stability, high water content, stimuli-responsiveness, and their nano size (which enables their penetration into biofilms) make nanogels a promising technology in the biomedical field. However, exploring nanogels for biofilm treatment remains in its early stages. This review examined the status of nanogels application for the treatment of bacterial biofilms. Recent investigations studied nanogels derived from natural polymers like chitosan (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and alginate, among others, for eliminating and inhibiting biofilms. These nanogels were utilized as carriers for diverse antibiofilm agents, encompassing antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, natural extracts, and nanoparticles. Utilizing mechanisms like conventional antibody-mediated pathways, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy, and EPS degradation, these nanogels effectively administered antibiofilm drugs, exhibiting efficacy across several bacterial strains, notably Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and Escherichia coli (E. coli), among others. Despite showing promise, nanogels remain relatively underexplored in biofilm treatment. This review concludes that research gaps are still present in biofilm treatment processes including (i) a better understanding of the stimuli-responsive behaviors of nanogels, (ii) active targeting strategies, and (iii) the narrow spectrum of antibiofilm agents loaded into nanogels. Hence, future studies could be directed towards the following elements: the exploration of multi-strain biofilms rather than single-strain biofilms, other endogenous and exogenous stimuli to trigger drug release, active targeting mechanisms, a broader range of antibiofilm agents when employing nanogels, and fostering more comprehensive and reliable biofilm treatment strategies. This review found that there are currently several research gaps as well in the use of nanogels for biofilm therapy, and these include: (i) very limited exogenous and endogenous stimuli were explored to trigger drug release from nanogels, (ii) the active targeting strategies were not explored, (iii) a very narrow spectrum of antibiofilm agents was loaded into nanogels, and (iv) only biofilms of single strains were investigated."

Notably, DES3 exhibited remarkable anti-excystation properties, preventing 94% of cysts from reverting to trophozoites. In cytopathogenicity experiments, deep eutectic solvent formulations and dodecanoic acid alone reduced amoebae-induced human brain endothelial cell death, with DES2 showing the highest effects.

Among the various MXene-based electrode compositions prepared in this work, those composed of 15% and 20% MXene content were further evaluated for their potential in electrophysiological sensing applications. The samples underwent a range of characterization techniques, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), as well as mechanical and bio-signal sensing from the skin. The experimental findings indicated that the compositions demonstrated favorable bulk impedances of 280 and 111 Ω, along with conductivities of 0.462 and 1.533 mS/cm, respectively. Additionally, they displayed promising electrochemical stability, featuring charge storage densities of 0.665 mC/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1.99 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. By conducting mechanical tests, Young’s moduli were determined to be 2.61 MPa and 2.18 MPa, respectively. The composite samples exhibited elongation of 139% and 144%, respectively. Thus, MXene-based bioelectrodes show promising potential for flexible and wearable electronics and bio-signal sensing applications."

However, a significant limitation hampering stent efficacy is restenosis, triggered by neointimal hyperplasia and resulting in the loss of gain in lumen size, post-intervention. In this study, a nonlinear finite element model was developed to simulate stent crimping and expansion and its interaction with the surrounding vessel in the presence of a plaque. The main aim was to determine contact pressures and forces induced at the interface between an artery wall with hypocellular and calcified plaques and an expanded stent. The results demonstrated the drawbacks of plaque calcification, which triggered a sharp contact pressure and radial force surge at the interface as well as a significant rise in von Mises stress within the vessel, potentially leading to rupture and restenosis. A regression line was then established to relate hypocellular and calcified plaques. The adjusted coefficient of determination indicated a good correlation between contact pressures for calcified and hypocellular plaque models. Regarding the directionality of wall properties, contact pressure and force observations were not significantly different between isotropic and anisotropic arteries. Moreover, variations in friction coefficients did not substantially affect the interfacial contact pressures."

ZIF-8 was characterized using several tests, such as FT-IR, TGA, and PXRD, to examine the MOF’s crystalline structure and thermal stability. The results demonstrated high crystallinity and thermal stability up to a temperature of 550 °C. The experimental study showed that ZIF-8 is an excellent fluorescence quencher, with 78.39% quenching efficiency. Analyzing the adsorption mechanism of probe DNA into ZIF-8 revealed that they can form electrostatic and π–π stacking interactions, forming a P-DNA@ZIF-8 complex and that PET is more dominant than FRET in the quenching mechanism. This ZIF-8 biosensing platform showed high sensitivity towards COVID-19 RNA with an ultra-low limit of detection of 6.24 pM, a rapid detection time of 8 min, and high selectivity to COVID-19 RNA. Indeed, ZIF-8 experienced much lower fluorescence recovery when tested on two mismatched RNAs.

We also present the in vitro cell viability and biocompatibility of the alloy system. All samples structured with femtosecond laser exhibited superhydrophilic nature with 0° contact angle. In addition, the laser structured surfaces showed cell viability above 80 % and minimal cytotoxicity towards human keratinocytes. Moreover, a well-defined hydroxyapatite layer developed on the laser structured surface.

    "abstract": "The global dependence on fossil fuels continues to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, driving the search for cleaner energy alternatives like biohydrogen. Dark fermentation has emerged as a promising method for sustainable hydrogen production while simultaneously treating wastewater. However, optimizing biohydrogen yields remains challenging due to the complexity of biological interactions and environmental factors. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven approach to predict and enhance hydrogen production efficiency. In this review, recent studies employing ML techniques are systematically analyzed to evaluate their role in modeling and optimizing biohydrogen generation through dark fermentation. This review examines various ML models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, and gradient boosting techniques, for their effectiveness in optimizing fermentation conditions. Unlike traditional models like Monod kinetics, the anaerobic digestion model no.1 (ADM1), and response surface methodology (RSM), which are limited by fixed input ranges, results indicate that ML models outperform traditional statistical methods, with CatBoost achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 and SVM reaching 0.988. Key influencing factors include chemical oxygen demand, nickel concentration, and butyrate levels. Furthermore, the review also highlights methodological gaps, prioritization of lifecycle assessments and cost-benefit analyses, and also provides insights into the future integration of ML with experimental workflows. While ML-driven optimization has significantly improved hydrogen yields, further research is required to refine models, expand datasets, and improve scalability for industrial applications."

    "abstract": "By 2030, millions of new cancer cases will be diagnosed, as well as millions of cancer-related deaths. Traditional drug delivery methods have limitations, so developing smart drug delivery systems (SDDs) has emerged as a promising avenue for more effective and precise cancer treatment. Nanotechnology, particularly nanomedicine, provides innovative approaches to enhance drug delivery, including the use of nanoparticles. One such type of SDD is thermosensitive nanoparticles, which respond to internal and external stimuli, such as temperature changes, to release drugs precisely at tumor sites and minimize off-target effects. On the other hand, hyperthermia is a cancer treatment mode that goes back centuries and has become popular because it can target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive review of smart thermosensitive nanoparticles for cancer treatment, with a primary focus on organic nanoparticles. The integration of hyperthermia with temperature-sensitive nanocarriers, such as micelles, hydrogels, dendrimers, liposomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, offers a promising approach to improving the precision and efficacy of cancer therapy. By leveraging temperature as a controlled drug release mechanism, this review highlights the potential of these innovative systems to enhance treatment outcomes while minimizing adverse side effects."

Smart nanocarriers are able to encapsulate these drugs to deliver them to tumors while reducing their contact with the healthy cells and the subsequent side effects. Upon reaching their target, the release of the encapsulated drugs should be carefully controlled to achieve therapeutic levels at the required time. Light is one of the promising triggering mechanisms used as external stimuli to trigger drug release from the light-responsive nanocarriers. Photo-induced drug release can be achieved at a wide range of wavelengths: UV, visible, and NIR depending on many factors. In this review, photo-induced release mechanisms were summarized, focusing on liposomes and micelles. In general, light-triggering mechanisms are based on one of the following: changing the hydrophobicity of a nanocarrier constituent(s) to make it more soluble, introducing local defects within a nanocarrier (by conformational transformation or photo-cleavage of its lipids/polymers chains) to make it more porous or concentrating heat for thermo-sensitive nanocarriers to release their payload.

The successful coating of the MOF particles (Lip-Fe-BTC) with the phospholipid bilayer (PBL) was established by direct fusion into the synthesized liposomes. The liposome coating was verified using several techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The DLS measurements showed an increase in the average particle diameter of liposomes from 150 nm to 163.1 nm for Lip-Fe-BTC particles. The Fe-BTC particles had the highest average particle diameter (287.3 nm). These results demonstrated that the PBL reduced the aggregation of the particles and improved their dispersity in the release medium. The TGA results demonstrated the MOF's excellent thermal stability. Furthermore, the nanocarrier's loading efficiency and capacity were determined to be ~90% and ~13.5 wt%, respectively. The in-vitro DOX release experiments demonstrated that the DOX-loaded Fe-BTC and liposome-coated Fe-BTC particles showed good pH and US dual-responsive capability, making them promising nanocarriers for drug delivery. The application of US enhanced DOX release from both Fe-BTC and liposome-coated Fe-BTC. In the case of Fe-BTC-DOX particles, the application of US enhanced the DOX release to around 38% and 67%, at pH levels of 7.4 and 5.3, respectively. Similarly, DOX release from the Lip-Fe-BTC-DOX particles reached ~35% and ~53%, at pH levels of 7.4 and 5.3, respectively.

The traditional therapeutic approach has been proven insufficient and lacking in the suppression of tumor growth. The simultaneous delivery of multiple small-molecule chemotherapeutic drugs and genes improves the effectiveness of each treatment, thus optimizing efficacy and improving synergistic effects. Nanomedicines integrating inorganic, lipid, and polymeric-based nanoparticles have been designed to regulate the spatiotemporal release of the encapsulated drugs. Multidrug-loaded nanocarriers are a potential strategy to fight cancer and the incorporation of co-delivery systems as a feasible treatment method has projected synergistic benefits and limited undesirable effects. Moreover, the development of co-delivery systems for maximum therapeutic impact necessitates better knowledge of the appropriate therapeutic agent ratio as well as the inherent heterogeneity of the cancer cells. Co-delivery systems can simplify clinical processes and increase patient quality of life, even though such systems are more difficult to prepare than single drug delivery systems.

The emergence of smart drug delivery systems (SDDSs) utilizing nanoparticles as drug nanocarriers has shown great potential in enhancing the targetability of anticancer agents and limiting their side effects. Liposomes are among the most investigated nanoplatforms due to their promising capabilities of encapsulating hydrophilic, lipophilic, and amphiphilic drugs, biocompatibility, physicochemical and biophysical properties. Liposomal nanodrug systems have demonstrated the ability to alter drugs’ biodistribution by sufficiently delivering the entrapped chemotherapeutics at the targeted diseased sites, sparing normal cells from undesired cytotoxic effects. Combining liposomal treatments with ultrasound, as an external drug release triggering modality, has been proven effective in spatially and temporally controlling and stimulating drug release. Therefore, this paper reviews recent literature pertaining to the therapeutic synergy of triggering nanodrugs from liposomes using ultrasound. It also highlights the effects of multiple physical and chemical factors on liposomes’ sonosensetivity, several ultrasound-induced drug release mechanisms, and the efficacy of ultrasound-responsive liposomal systems in cancer therapy.

Sustainability can be achieved by transforming organic waste substances into bioenergy and biomaterials. Consequently, a considerable decline in the consumption of fossil fuel can be observed which in turn leads to a healthier environment. Various industrial attempts have been made for synthesis of biopolymers and biofuels. However, the traditional production strategies include economically unfavorable processes such as commercially available carbon sources, separation, and purification of biopolymers from microbial strains. In contrast, the advanced biotechnologies involve the consumption of inexpensive and widely available organic wastes as starting materials.

Moreover, the concept of integrated systems (simultaneous production of bioenergy and biopolymers from a single substrate composed of microbial strains, organic by-products, and waste substances) have further improved the economy as well as the ecological prospects of advanced biorefineries.

    "title": "Numerical modeling of sequential segmentation for enhancement of mixing inside microchannels — Mohamed Abdelgawad",
    "abstract": "This study investigates sequential segmentation as an active mixing technique inside microchannels. In sequential segmentation, the solvent and anti-solvent streams are divided into segments in the axial direction. Due to the non-uniform velocity profile exhibited in laminar flow, Taylor-Aris dispersion can improve mixing by several orders of magnitude as compared with pure molecular diffusion. We built a 3D numerical model using COMSOL Multiphysics® to optimize this technique. We studied the effect of segmentation frequency, duty cycle (DC), flow velocity, microchannel aspect ratio and configuration of the inlet branches on the concentration distribution. We found that channel aspect ratio (H:W) and segmentation frequency had the most significant effect on mixing efficiency. Increasing segmentation frequency was found to increase the mixing efficiency up to a certain limit beyond which mixing efficiency decreased. This decrease was due to the non-complete segmentation of both streams at high frequencies and the formation of continuous trailing stream of both the solvent and anti-solvent. These trailing streams, which mitigate the segmentation effect, also appear in low aspect ratio (i.e. wider) channels and, therefore, reduces the mixing efficiency. Unequal mixing ratios were achievable by changing the segmentation duty cycle without changing the mixing efficiency considerably. Changing the flow velocity did not cause considerable changes in the mixing efficiency. Our 3D model confirms that sequential segmentation can considerably improve mixing inside microchannels and introduces the channel aspect ratio, for the first time, as an important parameter affecting the segmentation mixing efficiency."

Nanocarriers can entrap chemotherapeutic drugs and deliver them to the diseased site, reducing the side effects associated with the systemic administration of conventional anticancer drugs.

Stimulation can be through endogenous or exogenous modalities, such as temperature, electromagnetic irradiation, ultrasound (US), pH, or enzymes. This review discusses the acoustic stimulation of different sonosensitive liposomal formulations. Emulsion liposomes, or eLiposomes, are liposomes encapsulating phase-changing nanoemulsion droplets, which promote acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) upon sonication.

    "abstract": "Single-plate digital microfluidic devices offer a set of advantages over two-plate devices such as better mixing, the ability to move larger volumes, and easier access to the droplet. Currently, the non-floating configuration, where all non-energized electrodes on the device are grounded, is the most common electrode switching scheme used in single-plate devices. However, this scheme is limited by the symmetry of the electric field around the energized electrode, which can prevent complete droplet transport to the energized electrode for small droplets that can be seamlessly manipulated on two-plate devices. Here we present a numerical model to analyze the effect of droplet volume on the electrical forces generated on droplets actuated on single-plate digital microfluidic devices. We show that the commonly used non-floating switching scheme has a limit on the smallest droplet volume it can manipulate even if the droplet base diameter is larger than the electrode length; a condition that is currently believed sufficient for complete droplet movement. The model we built used Maxwell Stress tensor to calculate the electrical forces on the droplet to capture the effect of the grounding scheme more accurately than the contact angle change model. We used this model to analyze movability of droplets of various volumes and contact angles to find the minimum volume that can be successfully actuated. We also suggest better electrode designs that improve actuation of small droplets on single-plate devices and make their performance comparable to two-plate devices."

    "abstract": "Due to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and surface-conjugation capabilities, liposomes are effective nanocarriers that can encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs and facilitate targeted delivery across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, strategies have been explored to synthesize liposomes that respond to internal and/or external stimuli to release their payload controllably. Although research into liposomes for brain cancer treatment is still in its infancy, these systems have great potential to fundamentally change the drug delivery landscape. This review paper attempts to consolidate relevant literature regarding the delivery to the brain using nanocarriers, particularly liposomes. The paper first briefly explains conventional treatment modalities for cancer, followed by describing the blood–brain barrier and ways, challenges, and techniques involved in transporting drugs across the BBB. Various nanocarrier systems are introduced, with attention to liposomes, due to their ability to circumvent the challenges imposed by the BBB. Relevant studies involving liposomal systems researched to treat brain tumors are reviewed in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Finally, the challenges associated with the use of liposomes to treat brain tumors and how they can be addressed are presented."

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, and its treatment is further complicated by the high selectivity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The scientific community is urgently seeking innovative and effective therapeutic solutions. Liposomes are a promising new tool that has shown potential in addressing the limitations of chemotherapy, such as poor bioavailability and toxicity to healthy cells. However, passive targeting strategies based solely on the physicochemical properties of liposomes have proven ineffective due to a lack of tissue specificity. Accordingly, the upregulation of transferrin receptors (TfRs) in brain tissue has led to the development of TfR-targeted anticancer therapeutics. Currently, one of the most widely adopted methods for improving drug delivery in the treatment of GBM and other neurological disorders is the utilization of active targeting strategies that specifically target this receptor. In this review, we discuss the role of Tf-conjugated liposomes in GBM therapy and present some recent studies investigating the drug delivery efficiency of Tf-liposomes; in addition, we address some challenges currently facing this approach to treatment and present some potential improvement possibilities."

In this study, we have prepared pegylated liposomes using four types of phospholipids with similar saturated hydrocarbon tails including a phospholipid with no head group attached to the phosphate head (DPPA) and three other phospholipids with different head groups attached to their phosphate heads (DPPC, DPPE and DPPG). The prepared liposomes were conjugated to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (TRA) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressed on HER2-positive cancer cells (HER2+). We have compared the response of the different formulations of liposomes when triggered with low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) and their cellular uptake by the cancer cells. The results showed that the different formulations had similar size, polydispersity, and stability. TRA-conjugated DPPC liposomes showed the highest sensitivity to LFUS. On the other hand, incubating the cancer cells with TRA-conjugated DPPA liposomes triggered with LFUS showed the highest uptake of the loaded calcein by the HER2+ cells."

One of the most common cancer treatment modalities is chemotherapy which involves administering anti-cancer drugs to the body. However, these drugs can lead to undesirable side effects on healthy cells. To overcome this challenge and improve cancer cell targeting, many novel nanocarriers have been developed to deliver drugs directly to the cancerous cells and minimize effects on the healthy tissues. The majority of the research studies conclude that using drugs encapsulated in nanocarriers is a much safer and more effective alternative than delivering the drug alone in its free form. This review provides a summary of the types of nanocarriers mainly studied for cancer drug delivery, namely: liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles, mesoporous nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and quantum dots. In this review, the synthesis, applications, advantages, disadvantages, and previous studies of these nanomaterials are discussed in detail.

Combustion and gasification processes produce bioenergy that is used in combined heat and power generation, while fermentation and transesterification processes produce biofuels that possess extensive application capabilities. Biochar produced from the pyrolysis of biomass is used in environmental remediation, as a catalyst in pyrolysis and transesterification reactions, and as supercapacitor electrodes for energy storage. Additionally, bio-oils, also produced from the pyrolysis, can be converted to transportation fuels after appropriate purification. Syngas, again generated through pyrolysis or gasification, is not only beneficial for industrially producing ammonia and hydrocarbons but can also be applied in gas turbines and reciprocating engines and as fuel in solid oxide fuel cells. Furthermore, biogas produced via anaerobic digestion serves as an adequate replacement for methane after purification, thereby allowing the purified biogas to be injected into the national grid. Additionally, bioethanol produced via fermentation is recognized as an efficient transportation fuel, and the escalating rate of global bioethanol production from the 2000s to the 2020s highlights the increasing consumer confidence. Moreover, biodiesel produced via the transesterification reaction can also serve as an effective replacement for regular diesel and can be used in typical compression ignition engines unaltered.

However, conventional chemotherapy-associated systemic administration of anticancer agents leads to many side effects. To achieve the desired control over the target site, active targeting of HER2-positive breast cancer cells can be achieved by conjugating liposomal vesicles with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and inducing release of the encapsulated drug using ultrasound. To further enhance the delivery efficiency, nanoemulsion droplets exhibiting responsiveness to low-frequency ultrasound are encapsulated within these lipid vesicles. In this study, we prepared four different liposomal formulations, namely pegylated liposomes, emulsion liposomes (eLiposomes), HER-conjugated liposomes, and HER-conjugated eLiposomes, each loaded with calcein and subjected to a thorough characterization process. Their sizes, phospholipid concentration, and amount of antibody conjugation were compared and analyzed. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm the encapsulation of nanoemulsion droplets within the liposomes. The drug-releasing performance of Herceptin-conjugated eLiposomes was found to surpass that of other liposomal formulations with a notably higher calcein release and established it as a highly effective nanocarrier. The study showcases the efficacy of calcein-loaded and Herceptin-conjugated eLiposomes, which demonstrate rapid and efficient drug release among other liposomal formulations when subjected to ultrasound. This discovery paves the way for a more targeted, efficient, and humane approach to cancer therapy."

Recently, we have reported using estrone as an endogenous ligand on doxorubicin-encapsulating liposomes to target estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. Estrone liposomes were synthesized using the thin-film hydration method, which is a long, arduous, and multistep process. Here, we report using a herringbone micromixer to synthesize estrone liposomes in a simple and rapid manner. A solvent stream containing the lipids was mixed with a stream of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) inside a microchannel integrated with herringbone-shaped ridges that enhanced the mixing of the two streams. The small scale involved enabled rapid solvent exchange and initiated the self-assembly of the lipids to form the required liposomes. The effect of different parameters on liposome size, such as the ratio between the flow rate of the solvent and the buffer solutions (FRR), total flow rate, lipid concentrations, and solvent type, were investigated. Using this commercially available chip, we obtained liposomes with a radius of 66.1 ± 11.2 nm (mean ± standard deviation) and a polydispersity of 22% in less than 15 minutes compared to a total of ∼ 11 hours using conventional techniques. Calcein was encapsulated inside the prepared liposomes as a model drug and was released by applying ultrasound at different powers. The size of the prepared liposomes was stable over a period of one month. Overall, using microfluidics to synthesize estrone liposomes simplified the procedure considerably and improved the reproducibility of the resulting liposomes."

    "abstract": "Improving the efficacy of chemotherapy remains a key challenge in cancer treatment, considering the low bioavailability, high cytotoxicity, and undesirable side effects of some clinical drugs. Targeted delivery and sustained release of therapeutic drugs to cancer cells can reduce the whole-body cytotoxicity of the agent and deliver a safe localized treatment to the patient. There is growing interest in herbal drugs, such as curcumin, which is highly noted as a promising anti-tumor drug, considering its wide range of bioactivities and therapeutic properties against various tumors. Conversely, the clinical efficacy of curcumin is limited because of poor oral bioavailability, low water solubility, instability in gastrointestinal fluids, and unsuitable pH stability. Drug-delivery colloid vehicles like liposomes and nanoparticles combined with microbubbles and ultrasound-mediated sustained release are currently being explored as effective delivery modes in such cases. This study aimed to synthesize and study the properties of curcumin liposomes (CLs) and optimize the high-frequency ultrasound release and uptake by a human breast cancer cell line (HCC 1954) through in vitro studies of culture viability and cytotoxicity. CLs were effectively prepared with particles sized at 81 ± 2 nm, demonstrating stability and controlled release of curcumin under ultrasound exposure. In vitro studies using HCC1954 cells, the combination of CLs, ultrasound, and Definity microbubbles significantly improved curcumin’s anti-tumor effects, particularly under specific conditions: 15 s of continuous ultrasound at 0.12 W/cm<sup>2</sup> power density with 0.6 × 10<sup>7</sup> microbubbles/mL. Furthermore, the study delved into curcumin liposomes’ cytotoxic effects using an Annexin V/PI-based apoptosis assay. The treatment with CLs, particularly in conjunction with ultrasound and microbubbles, amplified cell apoptosis, mainly in the late apoptosis stage, which was attributed to heightened cellular uptake within cancer cells."

The platform costs around $208 and enables the generation of flow rate ratios (FRR) of up to 47:1 for the continuous flow synthesis of NPs. The pump has a resolution of 500 Pa per stroke and exhibits stable pressures for up to a few hours.

In this study, microwave (MW) irradiation is used as a novel stimulus in vitro controlled release of Doxorubicin (DOX) from two MOFs, namely Fe-BTC and MIL-53(Al), to enhance drug delivery in cancer therapy. DOX was encapsulated into Fe-BTC and MIL-53(Al) with drug-loading efficiencies of up to 67% for Fe-BTC and 40% for MIL-53(Al). Several characterization tests, including XRD, FTIR, TGA, BET, FE-SEM, and EDX, confirmed both MOF samples’ drug-loading and -release mechanisms. Fe-BTC exhibited a substantial improvement in drug-release efficiency (54%) when exposed to microwave irradiation at pH 7.4 for 50 min, whereas 11% was achieved without the external modality. A similar result was observed at pH 5.3; however, in both cases, the release efficiencies were substantially higher with microwave exposure (40%) than without (6%). In contrast, MIL-53(Al) exhibited greater sensitivity to pH, displaying a higher release rate (66%) after 38 min at pH 5.3 compared to 55% after 50 min at pH 7.4 when subjected to microwave irradiation. These results highlight the potential of both MOFs as highly heat-responsive to thermal stimuli. The results of the MTT assay demonstrated the cell viability across different concentrations of the MOFs after two days of incubation. This suggests that MOFs hold promise as potential candidates for tumor targeting. Additionally, the fact that the cells maintained their viability at different durations of microwave exposure confirms that the latter is a safe modality for triggering drug release from MOFs."

One emerging trend in cancer treatment is the utilization of Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs), facilitated by nanotechnology. Nanoparticles, ranging from 1 nm to 1000 nm, act as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents, enabling precise drug delivery. The triggered release of these agents is vital for advancing this novel drug delivery system. Our research investigated this multifaceted delivery capability using liposomes and metal organic frameworks as nanocarriers and utilizing all three targeting techniques: passive, active, and triggered. Liposomes are modified using targeting ligands to render them more targeted toward certain cancers. Moieties are conjugated to the surfaces of these nanocarriers to allow for their binding to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, thus increasing the accumulation of the agent at the tumor site. A novel class of nanocarriers, namely metal organic frameworks, has emerged, showing promise in cancer treatment. Triggering techniques (both intrinsic and extrinsic) can be used to release therapeutic agents from nanoparticles, thus enhancing the efficacy of drug delivery. In this study, we develop a predictive model combining experimental measurements with deep learning techniques. The model accurately predicts drug release from liposomes and MOFs under various conditions, including low- and high-frequency ultrasound (extrinsic triggering), microwave exposure (extrinsic triggering), ultraviolet light exposure (extrinsic triggering), and different pH levels (intrinsic triggering). The deep learning-based predictions significantly outperform linear predictions, proving the utility of advanced computational methods in drug delivery.

We functionalized liposomes with estrone ligands to enhance their uptake by the estrone-positive MCF-7 cells and, therefore, achieved a notably increased uptake compared to control liposomes. Furthermore, increasing the shear stress on the cells cultured inside microchannels, while keeping all other variables unchanged, resulted in a 57% increase in the cellular uptake. This indicates the importance of evaluating the efficacy of targeted drug delivery nanocarriers under dynamic conditions mimicking the physiological environment inside the body."

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has shown potential for modeling complex drug delivery systems and predicting drug release dynamics with a greater degree of precision. In this regard, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are two ML algorithms that have been extensively applied in various biomedical and drug delivery contexts. Yet, direct comparisons of their predictive accuracy in modeling ultrasound-triggered drug release from liposomes remain limited. Existing studies predominantly focus on drug release under static conditions or with limited external stimuli rather than the dynamic, nonlinear responses observed under ultrasound exposure. Objective: This study presents a comparative analysis of RF and SVM for predicting calcein release from ultrasound-triggered, targeted liposomes under varied low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) power densities (6.2, 9, and 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Methods: Liposomes loaded with calcein and targeted with seven different moieties (cRGD, estrone, folate, Herceptin, hyaluronic acid, lactobionic acid, and transferrin) were synthesized using the thin-film hydration method. The liposomes were characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering and Bicinchoninic Acid assays. Extensive data collection and preprocessing were performed. RF and SVM models were trained and evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R²), and the a20 index as performance metrics. Results: RF consistently outperformed SVM, achieving R<sup>2</sup> scores above 0.96 across all power densities, particularly excelling at higher power densities and indicating a strong correlation with the actual data. Conclusion: RF outperforms SVM in drug release prediction, though both show strengths and apply based on specific prediction needs."

Two main sources of these delays are numerically and experimentally investigated, the hydraulic compliance which originates from the flexibility of the system components (microchannel, tubing, syringe, etc.), and the compressibility of the liquid dead volume in the setup, also known as the “bottleneck effect”. A fluid-structure interaction model is presented for the compliance of rectangular PDMS microchannels that is used to form a numerically based relation for the compliance as a function of the pressure and geometry. This relation is successfully able to predict the dynamics of the flow inside PDMS microchannels in stop-flow experiments. The time delays associated with the bottleneck effect is also shown when using different syringe volumes, microchannel resistances, and liquid types. In these tests, the bottleneck effect has a much larger effect compared to the compliance of the PDMS microchannels. This is true even when using softer PDMS by increasing the monomer-to-curing agent mixing ratio. The characterization that is presented here allows for a simple analysis of microfluidic networks using the hydraulic-circuit approach."

Enzymatic remediation of phenolic wastewater, inspired by the catalytic function of laccases, has recently emerged as an attractive and environmentally benign treatment technology. However, this process is still expensive and laborious. Thus, the development of machine learning models for predicting the enzymatic remediation efficiency of phenolic pollutants would minimize the laborious experimentation efforts and save the resources. Accordingly, machine learning prediction of the enzymatic removal of bisphenol A (BPA), as a model phenolic pollutant, from wastewater samples has been explored in this work for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The experimental data were collected under various conditions (i.e., different temperatures, pH, salinity, initial BPA concentration, and enzyme concentration) in the presence of bio-based (i.e., rhamnolipids) and chemical based (i.e., polyethylene glycol (PEG), Triton X-100, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)) additives. The collected data were utilized to train various machine learning models. Among the utilized models (i.e., support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, artificial neural network (ANN), linear regression, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)), the XGBoost model has demonstrated superb predictive accuracy of the BPA removal efficiency with a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.979 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.171.

To address the limited availability of ECG databases with QRS delineation labels, we present a method to use small databases to train deep learning object detection models for global QRSd estimation that involves minimal manual labeling of median beats. In our method, an ECG record is segmented into individual heartbeats, transformed into artificial images, and a Faster R-CNN model is utilized to estimate the global QRSd. Faster R-CNN models were tested with three different backbone configurations (VGG-16, VGG-19, and RESNET-18) and two ECG image formats: binary images in which each beat in each lead was represented by a separate image and RGB images in which the same beat from a trio of leads was superimposed by mapping each lead to a different color channel. Using 258 twelve-lead, 10-s digital ECG records acquired from 140 unique heart failure outpatients, the best-performing backbone, VGG-19 with RGB images, achieved root-mean-square and mean absolute errors for QRSd of 10.4 ± 0.8 ms and 8.2 ± 1.0 ms, respectively, during five-fold cross-validation. Testing with an independent, publicly available dataset yielded root-mean-square and mean absolute errors for QRSd of 7.0 ± 1.1 ms and 5.3 ± 0.9 ms, respectively. Therefore, our method provides high QRSd estimation accuracy while reducing the need for manual labeling and shows promise for generalization to independent databases, demonstrating potential for efficient training of deep learning models on small ECG databases."

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia with a worldwide prevalence of more than 37 million among the adult population. This elusive disease is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, along with increased rates of significant morbidity and eventual mortality. It is clinically diagnosed using medical-grade electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors in ambulatory settings. The recent emergence of consumer-grade wearables equipped with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors has exhibited considerable promise for non-intrusive continuous monitoring in free-living conditions. However, the scarcity of large-scale public PPG datasets acquired from wearable devices hinders the development of intelligent automatic AF detection algorithms unaffected by motion artifacts, saturated ambient noise, inter- and intra-subject differences, or limited training data. In this work, we present a deep learning framework that leverages convolutional layers with a bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) network and an attention mechanism for effectively classifying raw AF rhythms from normal sinus rhythms (NSR). We derive and feed heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse rate variability (PRV) features as auxiliary inputs to the framework for robustness. A larger teacher model is trained using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia ECG dataset. Through transfer learning (TL), its learned representation is adapted to a compressed student model (32x smaller) variant by using knowledge distillation (KD) for classifying AF with the UMass and MIMIC-III datasets of PPG signals. This results in the student model yielding average improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 2.0%, 15.05%, 11.7%, and 9.85%, respectively, across both PPG datasets. Additionally, we employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to confer a notion of interpretability to the model decisions. We conclude that through a combination of techniques such as TL and KD, i.e., pre-trained initialization, we can utilize learned ECG concepts for scarcer PPG scenarios.

Fluoroscopic 3D image estimation is performed in two steps: (1) deriving motion models and (2) optimization. To derive motion models, every phase in a 4D-CBCT set is registered to a reference phase chosen from the same set using deformable image registration (DIR). Principal components analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the displacement vector fields (DVFs) resulting from DIR into a few vectors representing organ motion found in the DVFs. The PCA motion models are optimized iteratively by comparing a cone-beam CT (CBCT) projection to a simulated projection computed from both the motion model and a reference 4D-CBCT phase, resulting in a sequence of fluoroscopic 3D images. Patient datasets were used to evaluate the method by estimating the tumor location in the generated images compared to manually defined ground truth positions. Experimental results showed that the average tumor mean absolute error (MAE) along the superior–inferior (SI) direction and the 95th percentile in two patient datasets were 2.29 and 5.79 mm for patient 1, and 1.89 and 4.82 mm for patient 2.

This disease causes bone fractures in the hip or spine, which result in increasing the risk of disabilities or even death. The current gold standard in osteoporosis diagnostics, X-ray, although reliable, it uses ionizing radiations that makes it unfeasible for early and continuous monitoring applications. Recently, microwave tomography (MWT) has been emerging as a biomedical imaging modality that utilizes non-ionizing electromagnetic signals to screen bones’ electrical properties. These properties are highly correlated to bones’ density, which makes MWT to be an effective and safe alternative for frequent testing in osteoporosis diagnostics. Results: Both the conventional and wearable simulated systems were successful in localizing the tibia and fibula bones in the enhanced MWT images. Furthermore, structure extraction of the leg’s model from the blind MWT images had a minimal error compared to the original one (L2-norm: 15.60%). Under five sequentially incremental bone volume fraction (BVF) scenarios simulating bones’ treatment procedure, bones were detected successfully and their densities were found to be inversely proportional to the real part of the relative permittivity values. Conclusions: This study paves the way towards implementing a safe and user-friendly MWT system that can be wearable to monitor bone degradation or treatment for osteoporosis cases. Methods: An anatomically realistic finite-element (FE) model representing the human leg was initially generated and filled with corresponding tissues’ (skin, fat, muscles, and bones) dielectric properties. Then, numerically, the forward and inverse MWT problems were solved within the framework of the finite-element method-contrast source inversion algorithm (FEM-CSI). Furthermore, image reconstruction enhancements were investigated by utilizing prior information about different tissues as an inhomogeneous background as well as by adjusting the imaging domain and antennas locations based on the prior structural information. In addition, the utilization of a medically approved matching medium that can be used in wearable applications, namely an ultrasound gel, was suggested. Additionally, an approach based on k-means clustering was developed to extract the prior structural information from blind reconstructions.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type and is the leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide. Breast screening and early detection are currently the most successful approaches for the management and treatment of this disease. Several imaging modalities are currently utilized for detecting breast cancer, of which microwave imaging (MWI) is gaining quite a lot of attention as a promising diagnostic tool for early breast cancer detection. MWI is a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, fast, convenient, and safe screening tool. The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date survey of the principles, developments, and current research status of MWI for breast cancer detection. This paper is structured into two sections; the first is an overview of current MWI techniques used for detecting breast cancer, followed by an explanation of the working principle behind MWI and its various types, namely, microwave tomography and radar-based imaging. In the second section, a review of the initial experiments along with more recent studies on the use of MWI for breast cancer detection is presented. Furthermore, the paper summarizes the challenges facing MWI as a breast cancer detection tool and provides future research directions. On the whole, MWI has proven its potential as a screening tool for breast cancer detection, both as a standalone or complementary technique. However, there are a few challenges that need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of this imaging modality and translate it to clinical settings."

This has an impact on both the tube hematocrit level (Fåhraeus effect) and the apparent blood viscosity (Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect). Blood flow, mass transfer across the microvessel membrane, and diffusion in the tissue affect the solute concentration profiles. The Krogh tissue cylinder concept, limiting mass transfer to a cylinder around each microvessel, and the marginal zone concept (introduced by Haynes to analyze blood flow dynamics in narrow tubes) are both used to develop a model for solute transfer from blood in microvessels to the surrounding tissues, based on fundamentals. The analysis accounts for advection and diffusion in each zone of the microvessel, solute transport in the microvessel membranes, and diffusion and reaction in the tissues. The present investigation provides an analytical solution. The approach can be extended to treat other kinetic models, while accounting for Fåhraeus and Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effects in blood microvessels. The model is validated against published results for glucose transport from blood to tissue."

CRC cancer symptoms or symptoms secondary to treatment, such as diarrhea, constipation, fatigue and loss of appetite are very common and has significant negative effects on the quality of life (QoL). Methods: This project was a cross-sectional study of colorectal cancer survivors diagnosed between 1 January 2015 and May 2017. Assessment was performed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the colorectal cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-CR 29) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data on potential predictors of scores were also collected. Results: 115 CRC patients from Middle, Eastern and Western regions of the KSA participated in the study. Participants have unexpectedly low global health score with a mean of 56.9±31.3. Physical functioning scale had the lowest score of 61.3±27.7. Regarding the generic symptoms of cancer, fatigue was the worst symptom, followed by appetite loss. Psychological wellbeing assessment utilizing HADS reveals alarming outcomes for survivors of CRC in the KSA with high proportion of participants with moderate to severe depression (55%) and a good proportion of participants with moderate to high anxiety (31%). Only 3.7% of participants reported receiving psychosocial support. Discussion: Results of this project reveal an overall trend of low scores of quality of life amongst colorectal cancer patients in the KSA when compared with regional or international figures. Consistent results for psychological wellbeing were reached. We recommend routine screening for quality of life and psychological wellbeing and including the outcomes per individual patient care. Psychological support is highly needed for cancer survivors."

    "abstract": "The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in medical resources being stretched to their limits. Chest X-rays are one method of diagnosing COVID-19; they are used due to their high efficacy. However, detecting COVID-19 manually by using these images is time-consuming and expensive. While neural networks can be trained to detect COVID-19, doing so requires large amounts of labeled data, which are expensive to collect and code. One approach is to use semi-supervised neural networks to detect COVID-19 based on a very small number of labeled images. This paper explores how well such an approach could work. The FixMatch algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification algorithm, was trained on chest X-rays to detect COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia and Lung Opacity. The model was trained with decreasing levels of labeled data and compared with the best supervised CNN models, using transfer learning. FixMatch was able to achieve a COVID F1-score of 0.94 with only 80 labeled samples per class and an overall macro-average F1-score of 0.68 with only 20 labeled samples per class. Fur-thermore, an exploratory analysis was conducted to determine the performance of FixMatch to detect COVID-19 when trained with imbalanced data. The results show a predictable drop in performance as compared to training with uniform data; however, a statistical analysis suggests that FixMatch may be somewhat robust to data imbalance, as in many cases, and the same types of mistakes are made when the amount of labeled data is decreased."

MR images segmentation is a complicated task due to the variability in the lesion’s shape, location and patients’ anatomy. This study proposes a new computerized diagnosis technique for detecting brain disorders based on features extracted from MR images. Data of 121 cases were used, including healthy and patients with brain disorders. The cases were classified into normal and abnormal, with abnormal representing brain disorders cases. The abnormal cases were fed into a classifier to identify brain disorders.

The lower transmission rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Asian countries compared with Western countries suggested that the wider community use of face masks has the potential to decrease transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A risk assessment model named Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model is used to quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of community face masks on SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (R<inf>0</inf>) and peak number of infectious persons. For a simulated population of one million, the model showed a reduction in R<inf>0</inf> of 49% and 50% when 60% and 80% of the population wore masks, respectively. Moreover, we present a modified model that considers the effect of mask-wearing after community vaccination.

Nevertheless, needle detection in ultrasound images is a difficult task, specifically at steep insertion angles. Purpose: A new method is presented to enable effective needle detection using ultrasound B-mode and power Doppler analyses. Methods: A small buzzer is used to excite the needle and an ultrasound system is utilized to acquire B-mode and power Doppler images for the needle. The B-mode and power Doppler images are processed using Radon transform and local-phase analysis to initially detect the axis of the needle. The detection of the needle axis is improved by processing the power Doppler image using alpha shape analysis to define a region of interest (ROI) that contains the needle. Also, a set of feature maps is extracted from the ROI in the B-mode image. The feature maps are processed using a machine learning classifier to construct a likelihood image that visualizes the posterior needle likelihoods of the pixels. Radon transform is applied to the likelihood image to achieve an improved needle axis detection. Additionally, the region in the B-mode image surrounding the needle axis is analyzed to identify the needle tip using a custom-made probabilistic approach. Our method was utilized to detect needles inserted in ex vivo animal tissues at shallow [(Formula presented.)), moderate [(Formula presented.)), and steep [(Formula presented.)] angles. Results: Our method detected the needles with failure rates equal to 0% and mean angle, axis, and tip errors less than or equal to 0.7°, 0.6 mm, and 0.7 mm, respectively.

Blood samples were collected from hemodialysis subjects with and without diabetes to detect indicators of pathological changes using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Metabolic profiles were analyzed based on clinically confirmed diabetic status and current HbA1c values. Five differentially significant metabolites were identified based on the clinically confirmed diabetic status, including hydroxyprogesterone and 3,4-Dihydroxymandelic acid. Similarly, we identified seven metabolites with apparent differences between Dialysis Diabetic (DD) and Dialysis non-Diabetic (DND) groups, including isovalerylglycine based on HbA1c values. Likewise, the top three metabolic pathways, including Tyrosine metabolism, were identified following the clinically confirmed diabetic status.

    "title": "Regression Analysis between the Different Breast Dose Quantities Reported in Digital Mammography and Patient Age, Breast Thickness, and Acquisition Parameters — Salam Dhou",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Screening mammography is considered the primary imaging modality for the early detection of breast cancer. The radiation dose from mammography increases the patients’ risk of radiation-induced cancer. The mean glandular dose (MGD), or the average glandular dose (AGD), provides an estimate of the absorbed dose of radiation by the glandular tissues of a breast. In this paper, MGD is estimated for the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral–oblique (MLO) views using entrance skin dose (ESD), X-ray spectrum information, patient age, breast glandularity, and breast thickness. Moreover, a regression analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of mammography acquisition parameters, age, and breast thickness on the estimated MGD and other machine-produced dose quantities, namely, ESD and organ dose (OD). Furthermore, a correlation study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the ESD and OD, and the estimated MGD per image view. This retrospective study was applied to a dataset of 2035 mammograms corresponding to a cohort of 486 subjects with an age range of 28–86 years who underwent screening mammography examinations. Linear regression metrics were calculated to evaluate the strength of the correlations. The mean (and range) MGD for the CC view was 0.832 (0.110–3.491) mGy and for the MLO view was 0.995 (0.256–2.949) mGy. All the mammography dose quantities strongly correlated with tube exposure (mAs): ESD (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.938 for the CC view and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.945 for the MLO view), OD (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.969 for the CC view and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.983 for the MLO view), and MGD (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.980 for the CC view and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.972 for the MLO view). Breast thickness showed a better correlation with all the mammography dose quantities than patient age, which showed a poor correlation. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between the calculated MGD and both the ESD (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.929 for the CC view and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.914 for the MLO view) and OD (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.971 for the CC view and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.972 for the MLO view). Furthermore, it was found that the MLO scan views yield a slightly higher dose compared to CC scan views. It was also found that the glandular absorbed dose is more dependent on glandularity than size. Despite being more reflective of the dose absorbed by the glandular tissue than OD and ESD, MGD is considered labor-intensive and time-consuming to estimate."

    "title": "An Edge-Based Selection Method for Improving Regions-of-Interest Localizations Obtained Using Multiple Deep Learning Object-Detection Models in Breast Ultrasound Images — Mohammad I. Daoud",
    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can be used to process breast ultrasound (BUS) images with the goal of enhancing the capability of diagnosing breast cancer. Many CAD systems operate by analyzing the region-of-interest (ROI) that contains the tumor in the BUS image using conventional texture-based classification models and deep learning-based classification models. Hence, the development of these systems requires automatic methods to localize the ROI that contains the tumor in the BUS image. Deep learning object-detection models can be used to localize the ROI that contains the tumor, but the ROI generated by one model might be better than the ROIs generated by other models. In this study, a new method, called the edge-based selection method, is proposed to analyze the ROIs generated by different deep learning object-detection models with the goal of selecting the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region. The proposed method employs edge maps computed for BUS images using the recently introduced Dense Extreme Inception Network (DexiNed) deep learning edge-detection model. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study that has employed a deep learning edge-detection model to detect the tumor edges in BUS images. The proposed edge-based selection method is applied to analyze the ROIs generated by four deep learning object-detection models. The performance of the proposed edge-based selection method and the four deep learning object-detection models is evaluated using two BUS image datasets. The first dataset, which is used to perform cross-validation evaluation analysis, is a private dataset that includes 380 BUS images. The second dataset, which is used to perform generalization evaluation analysis, is a public dataset that includes 630 BUS images. For both the cross-validation evaluation analysis and the generalization evaluation analysis, the proposed method obtained the overall ROI detection rate, mean precision, mean recall, and mean F1-score values of (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.), respectively. Moreover, the results show that the proposed edge-based selection method outperformed the four deep learning object-detection models as well as three baseline-combining methods that can be used to combine the ROIs generated by the four deep learning object-detection models. These findings suggest the potential of employing our proposed method to analyze the ROIs generated using different deep learning object-detection models to select the ROI that improves the localization of the tumor region."

Although research into its mechanism has received the attention it deserves, our understanding of T2D is still limited. This case-control study employs untargeted metabolomics to explore novel T2D plasma biomarkers in the Emirati population. Ninety-two UAE nationals were included in the cohort, with fifty T2D and forty-two non-T2D profiles. Participants were then stratified into three groups based on metabolic profiles, clinically verified diabetic status, and current HbA1c values: namely controlled diabetics, uncontrolled diabetics and prediabetics, and non-diabetics. The study identified fifteen significant differentially abundant metabolites between the uncontrolled diabetics group and the prediabetics or controlled diabetics group. Interestingly, some metabolites essential for the corticosteroid and thyroid signaling pathways were found to be significantly elevated in poorly controlled T2D, including cortisol, glycocholic acid, bile acids, thyroxine, and the tryptophan metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. These findings align with those from prior western cohorts and suggest an intriguing linkage between T2D glycemic control and thyroid and adrenal signaling that may provide new diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Research significance: This study investigates the underlooked metabolomic role and correlation with T2D in the UAE population. The report indicates fifteen significant differentially abundant metabolites between on diabetics, uncontrolled diabetics and or controlled diabetics or prediabetics. This panel of metabolites such as thyroxine and corticosteroids should be considered further as potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for T2D in the region."

However, analyzing WSI is a very challenging task due to the multiple-resolution, large-scale nature of these images. Therefore, WSI-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) analysis gains increasing attention as a secondary decision support tool to enhance healthcare by alleviating pathologists’ workload and reducing misdiagnosis rates. Recent revolutionized deep learning techniques are promising and have the potential to achieve efficient automatic representation of WSI features in a data-driven manner.

This is by analyzing the model using five different numerical methods. Furthermore, the effect of the time step size and the various parameters affecting the diabetic situation is examined. The DC model is dependent on some parameters whose values play a vital role in the convergence of the model. Thus, parametric analysis was implemented and later discussed in this paper. Essentially, the Runge–Kutta (RK) method provides the highest accuracy. Moreover, Adam–Moulton’s method also provides good results. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of the development of diabetes complications after diagnosis is provided in this paper.

We analyzed the performance of statistical process control (SPC) methods in detecting HCFA NTM outbreaks. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 3 NTM outbreaks that occurred from 2013 to 2016 at a tertiary care hospital. The outbreaks consisted of pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) acquisition, cardiac surgery–associated extrapulmonary MABC infection, and a bronchoscopy-associated pseudo-outbreak of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). We analyzed monthly case rates of unique patients who had positive respiratory cultures for MABC, non-respiratory cultures for MABC, and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures for MAC, respectively. For each outbreak, we used these rates to construct a pilot moving average (MA) SPC chart with a rolling baseline window. We also explored the performance of numerous alternative control charts, including exponentially weighted MA, Shewhart, and cumulative sum charts. Results. The pilot MA chart detected each outbreak within 2 months of outbreak onset, preceding actual outbreak detection by an average of 6 months. Over a combined 117 months of pre-outbreak and post-outbreak surveillance, no false-positive SPC signals occurred (specificity, 100%). Prospective use of this chart for NTM surveillance could have prevented an estimated 108 cases of NTM. Six high-performing alternative charts detected all outbreaks during the month of onset, with specificities ranging from 85.7% to 94.9%. Conclusions. SPC methods have potential to substantially improve HCFA NTM surveillance, promoting early outbreak detection and prevention of NTM infections.

Dialysis treatments generate a vast amount of data, with more than 100 parameters that must be regulated for ideal treatment outcomes. When complications occur, understanding electrolyte parameters and predicting their outcomes to deliver the optimal dialysis dosing for each patient is a challenge. This study focused on refining dialysis dosing by utilizing emerging data from the growing number of dialysis patients to improve pa-tients’ quality of life and well-being. Methods: Exploratory data analysis and data prediction approaches were performed to gather insights from patients’ vital electrolytes on how to improve the patients’ dialysis dosing. Four predictive models were constructed to predict electrolyte levels through various dialysis parameters. Results: The decision tree model showed excel-lent performance and more accurate results than the support vector machine, linear regression, and neural network models. Conclusions: The predictive models identified that pre-dialysis blood urea nitrogen, pre-weight, dry weight, anticoagulation, and sex had the most significant effects on electrolyte concentrations. Such models could fine-tune dialysis dosing levels for the growing number of dialysis patients to improve each patient’s quality of life, life expectancy, and well-being, and to reduce costs, efforts, and time consumption for both patients and physicians. The study’s results need to be validated on a larger scale."

We present the use of dynamic diffuse optical tomography (DDOT) system to measure blood flow in the foot during venous and arterial occlusions. DDOT is a non-ionizing, contrast-free, and fast imaging modality. The DDOT system consists of 4 sensors, each containing four laser diodes (at wavelengths of 670, 780, 808, and 850 nm) and two silicon photodiodes. We examined 11 healthy subjects with a protocol consisting of five consecutive measurements. Biomarkers were extracted from changes in hemoglobin concentrations during the measurements. The results from a pilot study are presented in this report. The average increase in total hemoglobin was 17.2 ±5.8 μ M during a measurement with 60 mmHg occlusion and 10.4 ± 6.7 μ M during a measurement with 180 mmHg occlusion. The biomarkers can quantify blood perfusion and oxygen consumption in the foot, and they have the potential to detect and monitor PAD."

Therefore, speckle suppression is vital whenever ultrasound imaging is used. In this research, an efficient adaptive ultrasound image filter is proposed to reduce ultrasound speckle while maintaining the edge cues in the image. In particular, the pixels that correspond to tissue boundaries are identified by computing the edge map of ultrasound image, and the noisy pixels are determined by calculating the image radiation. The proposed filtering method is designed to adaptively apply different window sizes and bandwidths based on the edge map and image radiation. The proposed method is employed to process a set of ultrasound images and the filtering performance is assessed using a set of broadly accepted filtering metrics. These metrics aim to evaluate the filtering performance, including the capability of the filter to preserve the edges and maintain the image quality. The performance of the proposed filtering method is compared with eight existing image filtering methods. The experimental results indicated that the proposed filtering method enables effective edge preservation and retains image quality. These results suggest the potential of the proposed filtering method to achieve effective speckle suppression in ultrasound images."

Although a variety of Deep Learning (DL) models exist for the purposes of image classification in the medical domain, more analysis needs to be conducted on their decision-making processes. For this reason, several novel Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in recent years to better understand DL models. Currently, medical professionals rely on visual inspections to diagnose potential diseases in endoscopic imaging in the preliminary stages. However, we believe that the use of automated systems can enhance both the efficiency for such diagnoses. The aim of this study is to increase the reliability of model predictions within the field of endoscopic imaging by implementing several transfer learning models on a balanced subset of Kvasir-capsule, a Wireless Capsule Endoscopy imaging dataset. This subset includes the top 9 classes of the dataset for training and testing. The results obtained were an F1-score of 97% ±1% for the Vision Transformer model, although other models such as MobileNetv3Large and ResNet152v2 were also able to achieve F1-scores of over 90%. These are currently the highest-reported metrics on this data, improving upon prior studies done on the same dataset. The heatmaps of several XAI techniques, including GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayersCAM, LIME, and SHAP have been presented in image form and evaluated according to their highlighted regions of importance.

A crucial requirement to develop these systems is to accurately outline the kidney in ultrasound images. The majority of the computer-based methods that are proposed for outlining the kidney in ultrasound images are based on conventional segmentation approaches, such as active contour algorithms. Recently, deep learning semantic segmentation models have been employed to outline the kidney in ultrasound images. However, limited work has been made to investigate the possibility of combining conventional segmentation methods with the recently introduced deep learning semantic segmentation models to achieve effective outlining of the kidney. This study investigates the feasibility of combining deep learning semantic segmentation with a conventional active contour segmentation algorithm with the goal of improving the outlining of the kidney in ultrasound images. In particular, the performance of three deep learning semantic segmentation models, which are configured to use different backbone convolutional neural networks, has been studied in terms of their ability to detect the pixels that belong to the kidney in the ultrasound image. The best performing semantic segmentation approach is used to generate an initial outline for the kidney. Furthermore, a conventional edge-based active contour segmentation algorithm is used to refine and improve the initial kidney outline. The results indicate that our proposed approach for combining the deep learning semantic segmentation with the conventional edge-based active contour segmentation has achieved effective kidney outlining with Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, and Jaccard values of 94.2%, 89.6%, 91.0%, 98.4%, and 84.5%, respectively."

Computer-aided diagnosis systems can enhance the accuracy of ultrasound-based breast cancer diagnosis, but the creation of these systems necessitates the utilization of effective techniques for detecting the region-of-interest (ROI) that encloses the tumor. The goal of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing the RetinaNet deep learning model for detecting the ROIs in breast ultrasound images. To the best of our knowledge, the RetinaNet model has not been employed previously to detect the ROIs in breast ultrasound images. To achieve this goal, the ultrasound image is processed using contrast enhancement and sharpening to synthesize an RGB image with the aim of improving the possibility of detecting the ROI. The synthesized RGB image is analyzed using a fine-tuned RetinaNet model to detect the ROI. The performance of the RetinaNet model was assessed and compared with four leading deep learning object detection models, using a dataset of 380 breast ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that the RetinaNet model outperformed the other models, with a failure rate of 7%, a mean recall value of 89%, a mean precision value of 89%, and a mean F1-score value of 88%.

Chest X-ray (CXR) provides an inexpensive imaging mode for lung cancer diagnosis. Computer vision algorithms have previously been proposed to assist human radiologists in this task; however, leading studies use down-sampled images and computationally expensive methods with unproven generalization. In contrast, this study localizes lung nodules from CXR images using efficient encoder-decoder neural networks that have been crafted to process full resolution input images, thereby avoiding signal loss resulting from down-sampling. Encoder-decoder networks are trained and tested using the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology dataset. The networks are used to localize lung nodules from an independent CXR dataset. These experiments allow for the determination of the optimal network depth, image resolution, and pre-processing pipeline for generalized lung nodule localization. We find that more subtle nodules are detected in earlier training epochs. Therefore, we propose a novel self-ensemble model from three consecutive epochs centered on the validation optimum. This ensemble achieved a sensitivity of 85% in 10-fold internal testing with false positives of 8 per image. A sensitivity of 81% is achieved at a false positive rate of 6 following morphological false positive reduction. This result is comparable to more computationally complex systems, but with a sub-second inference time that is faster than other methods presented in the literature. The proposed algorithm achieved excellent generalization results against a challenging external dataset with a sensitivity of 77% at a false positive rate of 7.6."

With the advent of automated public health clinical support systems aided by machine learning (ML), there is potential to triage and prioritize at-risk strata of the population. In this work, we seek to assess the utility of algorithmic techniques applied to routinely available electronic health records (EHR) in classifying three types of TB: active in the lung, non-active in the lung, and extrapulmonary. The Light Gradient Boosting (CB) algorithm achieved the comparatively highest overall scores of accuracy: 77.4%, sensitivity: 56.1%, specificity: 74.1%, and F1-score: 55.2% for the multi-class scenario. In addition, post-hoc clinical explainability is introduced by means of Shapley values and permutation feature importance. We then employ Spline-based smoothing calibration to enable uncertainty quantification and confer confidence levels to probabilistic predictions.

In this study, a dataset containing CT dose information for a cohort of 333 patients categorized into four CT exams, chest, cardiac angiogram, cardiac calcium score and abdomen/pelvis, was collected and retrospectively analyzed. Regression analysis and Pearson correlation were applied to estimate the relationships between patient-related factors, namely body mass index (BMI), weight and age as input variables, and CT dose indices, namely the volume CT dose index (CTDI<inf>vol</inf>), dose length product (DLP), patient effective dose (ED) and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE), as output variables. Moreover, the study investigated the correlation between the different CT dose indices. Using linear regression models and Pearson correlation, the study found that all CT dose indices correlate with BMI and weight in all CT exams with varying degrees as opposed to age, which did not demonstrate any significant correlation with any of the CT dose indices across all CT exams. Moreover, it was found that using multiple regression models where multiple input variables are considered resulted in a higher correlation with the output variables than when simple regression was used. Investigating the relationships between the different dose indices, statistically significant relationships were found between all dose indices.

Detecting and treating CAD early is crucial for preventing further progression of the disease. Computer-aided techniques are needed to automate the characterization of CAD conditions. In this paper, a novel approach for the automated identification of CAD utilizing improved energy estimation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is developed. Due to the multi-component nature of ECG and the nonlinear characteristics of energy operators, estimating their instantaneous energy may lead to cross-component interactions complicating the interpretation. To overcome this issue, variational mode decomposition with data-driven and adaptively initialized number of modes is suggested to estimate the accurate energy of ECG beat. In this process, instantaneous energy of each decomposed component is computed for enhanced energy estimation of each ECG beat. Multiple statistical features calculated from the localized region of ECG beat could effectively classify CAD-affected ECG beats with more than 99.80% accuracy with optimized ensemble classifier and 10-fold cross validation scheme.

The results revealed that all ten chosen deep learning models experienced a similar or improved performance when used in conjunction with a machine learning classifier. In particular, Vision Transformer (ViT) performed the best with a record accuracy of 96% using both the direct and hybrid approaches. However, the hybrid framework combining AlexNet with a Support Vector Machine achieved an accuracy of 94%, and although it falls short of ViT in terms of performance, it comprises far fewer parameters.

    "title": "Application of Infrared Thermography and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Systematic Review of Over a Decade (2013-2024) — Hasan Mir",
    "abstract": "Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging technique that uses an infrared (IR) camera to record and produce an image using IR radiation emitted from the body. IRT imaging has shown promise as a screening method for breast cancer, diabetic foot ulcers, and dry eye disease, among other medical disorders. The aim of this systematic review is to present a complete overview of the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with IRT imaging for medical decision support systems over the course of the last ten years (2013-2024). Several scientific databases, including PubMed, IEEE, and Google Scholar, were searched using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After meeting the requirements for inclusion, 131 papers were selected. The reviewed studies demonstrated how various AI techniques, including deep learning and classical machine learning, can be used to develop automated diagnosis systems using IRT images. The efficacy of these AI systems differed depending on the medical field; for example, they could identify dry eye disease with 90-100% accuracy, classify diabetic foot ulcers with 85-95% accuracy, and detect breast cancer with 80-100% accuracy. This review highlights the value of IRT imaging in early disease detection, especially when combined with AI techniques. This work discusses challenges in using deep learning (DL) models in healthcare, including data scarcity and ethical considerations. It also, proposes three main recommendations: dataset standardization for ethical data management, clear governance models for ethical practices, and the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address explainability issues."

    "title": "Accurate Needle Localization in the Image Frames of Ultrasound Videos — Mohammad I. Daoud",
    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during needle interventions, but localizing the needle in ultrasound videos remains a challenging task. This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based method to localize the needle in ultrasound videos. The method comprises three phases for analyzing the image frames of the ultrasound video and localizing the needle in each image frame. The first phase aims to extract features that quantify the speckle variations associated with needle insertion, the edges that match the needle orientation, and the pixel intensity statistics of the ultrasound image. The features are analyzed using a machine learning classifier to generate a quantitative image that characterizes the pixels associated with the needle. In the second phase, the quantitative image is processed to identify the region of interest (ROI) that contains the needle. In the third phase, the ROI is processed using a custom-made Ranklet transform to accurately estimate the needle trajectory. Moreover, the needle tip is identified using a sliding window approach that analyzes the speckle variations along the needle trajectory. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by localizing the needle in ex vivo and in vivo ultrasound videos. The results show that the proposed method was able to localize the needle with failure rates of 0%. The angular, axis, and tip errors computed for the ex vivo ultrasound videos are within the ranges of 0.3–0.7°, 0.2–0.7 mm, and 0.4–0.8 mm, respectively. Additionally, the angular, axis, and tip errors computed for the in vivo ultrasound videos are within the ranges of 0.2–1.0°, 0.3–1.0 mm, and 0.3–1.1 mm, respectively. A key advantage of the proposed method is the ability to achieve accurate localization of the needle without altering the clinical workflow of the intervention."

The expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive nature of the gold-standard approach, polysomnography (PSG), and the lack of regular monitoring of patients’ daily lives with existing solutions motivates the development of clinical support for enhanced prognosis. In this study, we utilize image representations of sleep stages and contextual patient-specific data, including medical history and stage durations, to investigate the use of wearable devices for OSA screening and comorbid conditions. For this purpose, we leverage the publicly available Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) dataset. Given that wearable devices are adept at detecting sleep stages (often using proprietary algorithms), and medical history data can be efficiently captured through simple binary (yes/no) responses, we seek to explore neural network models with this. Without needing access to the raw physiological signals and using epoch-wise sleep scores and demographic data, we attempt to validate the effectiveness of screening capabilities and assess the interplay between sleep stages, OSA, insomnia, and depression. Our findings reveal that sleep stage representations combined with demographic data enhance the precision of OSA screening, achieving F1 scores of up to 69.40. This approach holds potential for broader applications in population health management as a plausible alternative to traditional diagnostic approaches. However, we find that purely modality-agnostic sleep stages for a single night and routine lifestyle information by themselves may be insufficient for clinical utility, and further work accommodating individual variability and longitudinal data is needed for real-world applicability."

    "title": "Machine Learning-Based Approaches for Breast Density Estimation from Mammograms: A Comprehensive Review — Khaldoon Alhusari, Salam Dhou",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer, as of 2022, is the most prevalent type of cancer in women. Breast density—a measure of the non-fatty tissue in the breast—is a strong risk factor for breast cancer that can be estimated from mammograms. The importance of studying breast density is twofold. First, high breast density can be a factor in lowering mammogram sensitivity, as dense tissue can mask tumors. Second, higher breast density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, making accurate assessments vital. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the mammographic density estimation literature, with an emphasis on machine-learning-based approaches. The approaches reviewed can be classified as visual, software-, machine learning-, and segmentation-based. Machine learning methods can be further broken down into two categories: traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The most commonly utilized models are support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with classification accuracies ranging from 76.70% to 98.75%. Major limitations of the current works include subjectivity and cost-inefficiency. Future work can focus on addressing these limitations, potentially through the use of unsupervised segmentation and state-of-the-art deep learning models such as transformers. By addressing the current limitations, future research can pave the way for more reliable breast density estimation methods, ultimately improving early detection and diagnosis."

These models offer the potential to enhance disease diagnosis through data-driven approaches relying on non-invasive techniques. However, no studies have explored the application of fully non-invasive methods for predicting thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Consequently, this study introduces a novel, fully non-invasive framework for predicting TSH levels by developing an innovative hybrid machine learning model that balances performance, complexity, and interpretability. Seven ML models were evaluated, and the best-performing models were integrated into a hybrid approach to balance performance, complexity, and interpretability. A dataset of 6190 instances from Jordan was used for model development. Four-dimensional non-invasive factors, including demographics, symptoms, family history, and newly engineered symptom scores, were incorporated into the model. The hybrid model achieved an R<sup>2</sup> of 94.2 % and RMSE of 0.015, demonstrating superior predictive performance. Model interpretability was ensured using LIME and SHAP explainers, confirming aggregated symptom scores' critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy. A robust feature selection technique was implemented, reducing model complexity and enhancing performance. Among the top ten features for predicting TSH levels were hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism symptom scores, family history, cold intolerance, itchy-dry skin, sweating, hand tremors, and palpitations. The model can be employed to develop cost-effective diagnostic tools for thyroid disorders. It also offers a robust framework that can be generalized to predict other biomarkers and applied in diverse contexts."

Interpolation techniques have been used to generate intermediary projections to be used, along with the original projections, for reconstruction. Transfer learning is a powerful approach that harnesses the ability to reuse pre-trained models in solving new problems. Methods: Several state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models, used for video frame interpolation, are utilized in this work to generate intermediary projections. Moreover, a novel regression predictive modeling approach is also proposed to achieve the same objective. Digital phantom and clinical datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

The Stroop Color-Word Task (SCWT) was employed as a validated stress-inducing paradigm to assess pre- and post-stimulation changes. During the initial phase, the participants completed the SCWT. This was followed by either tACS or sham. In the third session, the individuals solved the task again. The anode and cathode for the transcranial tACS were placed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). tACS, was applied with current intensity of 1.5 mA at 16 Hz over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), aimed to modulate cortical activation and mitigate stress. Sham included 5-second ramp periods. Physiological data using alpha amylase and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) were utilized. The results revealed significant hemodynamic changes and reduced stress levels in the tACS group compared to the sham group (p < 0.001).

The experiment comprises four phases: rest state, control alertness, stress induction, and stress mitigation. Mental states were assessed using behavioral data: reaction time to stimuli (RT) and target detection accuracy, subjective reports: Perceived Stress Scale scores (PSS-10), biochemical indicators: salivary cortisol levels, and neurophysiological measure: EEG effective connectivity via Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). BBs significantly improved target detection accuracy by 31.6% and 22.8% for low and high-stress groups, respectively. PDC connectivity showed a shift to the temporal region during mitigation, indicating a return to a more balanced state.

The results indicate that tACS maintains the amplitude of the initial dip following stimulation, showing no significant change in amplitude (p > 0.05). In contrast, the sham group demonstrated a significant increase in initial dip amplitude (p < 0.05). This indicates that tACS improves neural efficiency by sustaining initial metabolic responses. Moreover, tACS-induced changes in functional connectivity demonstrated a reorganization of brain activity, characterized by a significant reduction in task-based connectivity (p < 0.001), which may enhance cognitive performance. Behavioral and physiological measures indicated a 15% reduction in salivary alpha amylase levels and a 20% improvement in NASA Task Load Index scores, thereby supporting the stress-mitigating effects of tACS. Machine learning classifiers demonstrated significant accuracy in differentiating brain states, achieving classification accuracies as high as 92.6% for the initial dip phase utilizing convolutional neural network.

Although the mechanisms of hypothermia action are yet to be fully explored, early hypothermia for patients suffering from acute SCI has already been implemented in clinical settings. This article discusses mea-sures for inducing various forms of hypothermia and summarizes several hypotheses describing the likelihood of hypothermia mechanisms of action. We present our objective neuro-electrophysiological results and demonstrate that early hypothermia manifests neuroprotective effects mainly during the first-and second-month post-SCI, depending on the severity of the injury, time of intervening, dura-tion, degree, and modality of inducing hypothermia. Nevertheless, eventually, its beneficial effects gradually but consistently diminish. In addition, we report potential complications and side effects for the administration of general hypothermia with a unique referment to the local hypothermia. We also provide evidence that instead of considering early hypothermia post-SCI a therapeutic approach, it is more a neuroprotective strategy in acute and sub-acute phases of SCI that mostly delay, but not entirely avoid, the natural history of the pathophysiological events. Indeed, the most crucial rationale for inducing early hypothermia is to halt these devastating inflammatory and apoptotic events as early and as much as possible. This, in turn, creates a larger time-window of opportunity for physicians to formulate and administer a well-designed personalized treatment for patients suffering from acute traumatic SCI."

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an effective method and has been extensively used in the suppression of EEG artifacts. However, in vigilance assessment applications, it was found to suffer from leakage of the cerebral activity into artifacts. In this work, we show that the wavelet ICA (wICA) method provides an alternative for artifact reduction, leading to improved vigilance level assessment results. We conducted an experiment in nine human subjects to induce two vigilance states, alert and vigilance decrement, while performing a Stroop Color–Word Test for approximately 45 min. We then compared the performance of the ICA and wICA preprocessing methods using five classifiers. Our classification results showed that in terms of features extraction, the wICA method outperformed the existing ICA method. In the delta, theta, and alpha bands, we obtained a mean classification accuracy of 84.66% using the ICA method, whereas the mean accuracy using the wICA methodwas 96.9%. However, no significant improvement was observed in the beta band. In addition, we compared the topographical map to show the changes in power spectral density across the brain regions for the two vigilance states. The proposed method showed that the frontal and central regions were most sensitive to vigilance decrement. However, in this application, the proposed wICA shows a marginal improvement compared to the Fast-ICA."

    "abstract": "Prostacyclin analogs are among the most effective and widely used therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, it is unknown whether they also confer protection through right ventricle (RV) myocardio‐specific mechanisms. Moreover, the use of prostacyclin analogs in severe models of PAH has not been adequately tested. To further identify underlying re-sponses to prostacyclin, a prostacyclin analogue, treprostinil, was used in a preclinical rat Sugen-chronic hypoxia (SuCH) model of severe PAH that closely resembles the human disease. Male Spra-gue–Dawley rats were implanted with osmotic pumps containing vehicle or treprostinil, injected concurrently with a bolus of Sugen (SU5416) and exposed to 3‐week hypoxia followed by 3‐week normoxia. RV function was assessed using pressure–volume loops and hypertrophy by weight as-sessed. To identify altered mechanisms within the RV, tissue samples were used to perform a cus-tom RNA array analysis, histological staining, and protein and transcript level confirmatory anal-yses. Treprostinil significantly reduced SuCH‐associated RV hypertrophy and decreased the rise in RV systolic pressure, mean pulmonary arterial (mPAP), and right atrial (RAP) pressure. Prostacy-clin treatment was associated with improvements in RV stroke work, maximum rate of ventricular pressure change (max dP/dt) and the contractile index, and almost a complete reversal of SuCH-associated increase in RV end‐systolic elastance, suggesting the involvement of load‐independent improvements in intrinsic RV systolic contractility by prostacyclin treatment. An analysis of the RV tissues showed no changes in cardiac mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. However, cus-tom RNA array analysis revealed amelioration of SuCH‐associated increases in newly identified TBX20 as well as the fibrotic markers collagen1α1 and collagen 3α1 upon treprostinil treatment. Taken together, our data support decreased afterload and load‐independent improvements in RV function following prostacyclin administration in severe PAH, and these changes appear to associ-ate with improvements in RV fibrotic responses."

    "abstract": "The recent advances in developing assistive devices have attracted researchers to use visual imagery (VI) mental tasks as a control paradigm to design brain–computer interfaces that can produce a large number of control signals. Consequently, this can facilitate the design of control mechanisms that allow locked-in individuals to interact with the surrounding world. This paper presents a two-phase approach for decoding visually imagined digits and letters using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The first phase employs the Choi–Williams time–frequency distribution (CWD) to construct a joint time, frequency, and spatial (TFS) representation of the EEG signals. The constructed joint TFS representation characterizes the variations in the energy encapsulated within the EEG signals over the TFS domains. The second phase presents a novel deep learning (DL) framework to automatically extract features from the constructed joint TFS representation of the EEG signals and decode the imagined digits and letters. The performance of our approach is assessed using an EEG dataset that was acquired for 16 healthy participants while imagining decimal digits and uppercase English letters. Our approach achieved an average ± standard deviation accuracy of 95.47±2.3%, which is significantly outperforming the accuracies obtained when the CWD is replaced with two alternative time–frequency analysis techniques, the accuracies obtained using four pre-trained DL models, and the accuracies obtained using CWD-based handcrafted features that are classified using four conventional classifiers. Moreover, the results of our proposed approach outperform those reported by several previous studies with regard to the accuracy and number of classes."

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of binaural beats stimulation (BBs) in enhancing cognitive vigilance and mitigating mental stress level at the workplace. We developed an experimental protocol under four cognitive conditions: high vigilance (HV), vigilance enhancement (VE), mental stress (MS) and stress mitigation (SM). The VE and SM conditions were achieved by listening to 16 Hz of BBs. We assessed the four cognitive conditions using salivary alpha-amylase, behavioral responses, and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We quantified the vigilance and stress levels using the reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of detection, and the functional connectivity metrics of the fNIRS estimated by Phase Locking Values (PLV). We propose using the orthogonal minimum spanning tree (OMST) to determine the true connectivity network patterns of the PLV. Our results show that listening to 16-Hz BBs has significantly reduced the level of alpha amylase by 44%, reduced the RT to stimuli by 20% and increased the accuracy of target detection by 25%, (p < 0.001). The analysis of the connectivity network across the four different cognitive conditions revealed several statistically significant trends. Specifically, a significant increase in connectivity between the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) areas and left orbitofrontal cortex was found during the vigilance enhancement condition compared to the high vigilance. Likewise, similar patterns were found between the right and left DLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and right frontopolar PFC (prefrontal cortex) area during stress mitigation compared to mental stress. Furthermore, the connectivity network under stress condition alone showed significant connectivity increase between the VLPFC and DLPFC compared to other areas. The laterality index demonstrated left frontal laterality under high vigilance and VE conditions, and right DLPFC and left frontopolar PFC while under mental stress. Overall, our results showed that BBs can be used for vigilance enhancement and stress mitigation."

Then, this work will apply these statistical tools quantitatively to a dataset collected from healthy subjects using high-density EEG recordings with over an order-of-magnitude more electrodes compared to previously reported works. The analysis results show that the maximal data-observation duration is found to be at most 0.2 seconds for a normality-test positivity rate of 98%; for 95%, 90%, 85%, and 80%, the respective ceilings can relax, respectively, to 0.3, 1.0, 1.6, and 2.9 seconds."

This condition is defined as emotional dysregulation resulting in persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest and inability to experience pleasure. Early detection can facilitate timely intervention in the form of psychological therapy and/or medication. With the widespread public adoption of wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, it is becoming increasingly possible to gain insights relating the mental states of individuals in an unobtrusive manner within free-living conditions. This work presents a machine learning (ML) approach that utilizes retrospectively collected data-derived consumer-grade wearables for passive detection of depression severity. The experiments conducted in this work reveal that multimodal analysis of physiological signals in terms of their discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features exhibit considerably better performance than unimodal scenarios. Additionally, we conduct experiments to view the impact of severity on emotional valence-arousal detection. We believe that our work has implications towards guiding development in the domain of multimodal wearable-based screening of mental health disorders and necessitates appropriate treatment interventions."

Staying alert is obligatory in many jobs, particularly those that involve monitoring, such as surveillance tasks, security monitoring, and air traffic control. These monitoring tasks require a specific level of arousal to maintain an adequate level of cognitive efficiency. In this study, we investigate the possibility of assessing the vigilance levels using a fusion of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking data. Vigilance levels were established by performing a modified version of the Stroop color word task (SCWT) for 30 minutes. Feature-level fusion based on the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was employed to each brain region to improve the classification accuracy of vigilance level assessment. Results obtained using support vector machines (SVM) classifier show that fusion of EEG+eye tracking modalities has improved the classification accuracy compared to individual modality. The EEG+Eye tracking fusion on the right central brain region achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.3%, compared to the individual Beta EEG with 92.0±7.3% and Eye tracking with 76.8±8.4%, respectively. Likewise, EEG and Eye tracking fusion on the right frontal region showed classification accuracy of 96.9 ± 1.1% for both the Alpha and Beta bands. Meanwhile, when all brain regions were utilized, the highest classification accuracy of EEG+Eye tracking was 96.8 ± 0.6% using Delta band compared to the EEG alone with 88.18 ± 8.5% and eye tracking alone with 76.8 ± 8.4 %, respectively.

We propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to decode the two classes of mental stress based on the fNIRS time series. Five-fold cross validation, two LSTM layers, as well as many trainable characteristics were used to construct the network. The induced mental stress increased the level of salivary alpha amylase significantly (p<0.001) by 32.09%.

One approach to understanding such a system is to model its most basic unit, neurons. The leaky integrate and fire (LIF) method models the neurons’ response to a stimulus. Given the fact that the model’s equation is a linear ordinary differential equation, the purpose of this research is to compare which numerical analysis method gives the best results for the simplified version of this model. Adams predictor and corrector (AB4-AM4) and Heun’s methods were then used to solve the equation. In addition, this study further researches the effects of different current input models on the LIF’s voltage output. In terms of the computational time, Heun’s method was 0.01191 s on average which is much less than that of the AB-AM4 method (0.057138) for a constant DC input. As for the root mean square error, the AB-AM4 method had a much lower value (0.0061) compared to that of Heun’s method (0.3272) for the same constant input. Therefore, our results show that Heun’s method is best suited for the simplified LIF model since it had the lowest computation time of 36 ms, was stable over a larger range, and had an accuracy of 72% for the varying sinusoidal current input model."

We quantified the levels of mental stress using the reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, and the functional connectivity network of the brain's electrical beta EEG signals estimated by Phase Locking Values (PLV). Our results showed that, the alpha amylase level has increased by 62% from the beginning of the mission to the end of the 240-days mission.

The functional connectivity network showed a significant decrease in the information flow in the frontal regions across all subjects with statistical significance of p <0.05.

The popular measure for the quantification of emotions outlines the affective states of arousal and valences, with high and low being the discrete categories of interest. Recent works explore the discernability of digital behavior differences between groups with and without mental disorders. However, the interaction between physiological states and affective states within a predominantly depressive population remains to be studied with the aid of wearables. Despite the pervasiveness of emotional state inference through the tracking of ubiquitous physiological trackers, such as heart rate, blood volume pulse, skin conductance, and motion, a dearth of work is noted in the exploration of physiological markers in single-modal and multimodal settings. This work provides an extensive evaluation of a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism ensembled with a random forest algorithm to effectively leverage multiple raw signal-to-image transformations as feature inputs to predict depression severity and affective state.

    "abstract": "Workers with demanding jobs are at risk of experiencing mental stress, leading to decreased performance, mental illness, and disrupted sleep. To detect elevated stress levels in the workplace, studies have explored stress measurement from physiological, psychological, and behavioral perspectives. This paper reviews the assessment methods and strategies for mitigating mental stress in the workplace and provides recommendations for early detection and mitigation of mental stress. Among the modalities, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) were found to be the most used in assessing mental stress in the workplace. Nevertheless, these modalities are sensitive to motion artifacts and are difficult to be integrated into real work environments. To further improve stress level assessment in the workplace, multimodality integration with a reduced number of sensors such as EEG, GSR and Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be utilized. This would lead to developing strategies for stress management in real-time. Furthermore, combining EEG with fNIRS would improve source localization of mental stress. To mitigate stress, we recommend developing a closed loop system that incorporates brain data acquisition systems and machine learning with physical stimulations such as audio Binaural Beats Stimulation and/or Transcranial Electric Stimulation."

    "title": "User Security-Oriented Information-Centric IoT Nodes Clustering with Graph Convolution Networks — Anastassia Gharib",
    "abstract": "Information-centric Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks allow users to access data directly from the sensing layer. This is done through cluster heads (CHs), which are selected as a result of IoT nodes' clustering. To respond to users' data requests, CHs aggregate, encrypt, and store locally sensed data in rounds. For data encryption, security resources are allocated to sensor nodes every round. To satisfy user security needs, very often, security resources are overutilized leading to higher energy consumption and shorter network lifetime. Meanwhile, sensor nodes' and users' mobility may result in link failures. Therefore, efficient clustering and security resource allocation is required to ensure users' data and security needs are satisfied while optimizing network resource utilization. Graph convolution networks (GCNs) can help to address this challenge. GCNs perform learning on graphs while considering non-Euclidean nodes' relations and features. Using GCNs, user awareness, and IoT nodes' features can be incorporated into the cluster-based management of mobile information-centric IoT sensor networks. Therefore, this article proposes user-aware clustering with security resource allocation (USRA) using GCNs. In USRA, the proposed clustering algorithm improves communication reliability by optimizing users' and nodes' coverage. Meanwhile, the proposed security resource allocation plan prevents overutilization of security resources by considering user security needs in each cluster. Compared to existing works, USRA achieves lower energy consumption on security while ensuring high user security satisfaction. This promotes a longer network lifetime. USRA further contributes to higher communication reliability and throughput with stable data delivery latency to users."

    "abstract": "Classifying mental stress is important as it helps in identifying the type and severity of stress, which can inform the most appropriate treatment or intervention. In this study, we propose utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) signals with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify four mental states: rest, control-alert, stress and stress mitigation. The mental stress state was induced using Stroop color word test (SCWT) with time constrains and was then mitigated using 16 Hz Binaural beat stimulation (BBs). We quantified the four mental states using the reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, subjective score, and functional connectivity images of EEG estimated by Phase Locking Value (PLV). Our results show that, the SCWT reduced the accuracy of target detection by 70% with (F= 24.56, p =.00001), and the BBs improved the accuracy by 28% (F= 4.54, p =.00470). The functional connectivity network showed different patterns between the frontal/occipital and parietal regions, under the four mental states. The proposed CNNs with PLV images differentiated between the four mental states with highest classification performance at beta frequency band with 80.95% accuracy, 80.36% sensitivity, 94.75% specificity, 83.63% precision and 81.96% F-score. The overall results suggest that 16 Hz BBs can be used as an effective method to mitigate stress and the proposed CNNs with EEG-PLV images as a promising method for classifying different mental states."

Continuous exposure to stress can greatly impact mental activity as well as physical health thereby leading to several diseases. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of audio binaural beat stimulation (BBs) in mitigating mental stress. We developed an experimental protocol to induce four mental states: rest, control, stress, and stress mitigation. The stress was induced by utilizing Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) with time constraints and mitigated, by listening to 16 Hz of BBs. The four mental states were assessed using behavioral responses (accuracy of target detection), a perceived stress state questionnaire (PSS-10), and electroencephalography (EEG). The mean spectral power of four frequency bands was estimated using Power Spectral Density (PSD), and five different machine learning classifiers were used to classify the four mental states. Our results show that SCWT reduced the detection accuracy by 59.58% while listening to 16-Hz BBs significantly increased the accuracy of detection by 27.08%, (p =.00392). Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) significantly outperformed other classifiers achieving the highest accuracy of 82.5 ± 2.0 % using the beta band information. Similarly, the PSD topographical maps showed different patterns between the four mental states, where the temporal region's PSD was mostly affected by stress. Nevertheless, under mitigation, there was a noticeable restoration in the temporal activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that BBs at 16 Hz can be used to mitigate stress levels."

This context underscores the growing sedentary behavior, exemplified by extended sitting hours among adults and university students.

Traditional detection involves clinical assessments and corrective exercises; however, this work proposes a multi-layered system for a back brace to detect, monitor, and potentially prevent the main signs of UCS. Building and using a framework that detects and monitors signs of UCS has facilitated patient–doctor interaction, automated the detection process for improved patient–physician coordination, and helped improve patients’ spines over time. The smart wearable brace includes inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors targeting hunched-back postures. The IMU sensors capture postural readings, which are then used for classification. Multiple classifiers were used where the long short-term memory (LSTM) model had the highest accuracy of 99.3%. Using the classifier helped detect and monitor UCS over time. Integrating the wearable device with a mobile interface enables real-time data visualization and immediate feedback for users to correct and mitigate UCS-related issues."

    "abstract": "Background SCI is a time-sensitive debilitating neurological condition without treatment options. Although the central nervous system is not programmed for effective endogenous repairs or regeneration, neuroplasticity partially compensates for the dysfunction consequences of SCI. Objective and hypothesis The purpose of our study is to investigate whether early induction of hypothermia impacts neuronal tissue compensatory mechanisms. Our hypothesis is that although neuroplasticity happens within the neuropathways, both above (forelimbs) and below (hindlimbs) the site of spinal cord injury (SCI), hypothermia further influences the upper limbs’ SSEP signals, even when the SCI is mid-thoracic. Study design A total of 30 male and female adult rats are randomly assigned to four groups (n = 7): sham group, control group undergoing only laminectomy, injury group with normothermia (37̊C), and injury group with hypothermia (32̊C +/-0.5̊C). Methods The NYU-Impactor is used to induce mid-thoracic (T8) moderate (12.5 mm) midline contusive injury in rats. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is an objective and non-invasive procedure to assess the functionality of selective neuropathways. SSEP monitoring of baseline, and on days 4 and 7 post-SCI are performed. Results Statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the SSEP signal amplitudes recorded when stimulating either forelimb in the group of rats with normothermia compared to the rats treated with 2h of hypothermia on day 4 (left forelimb, p = 0.0417 andright forelimb, p = 0.0012) and on day 7 (left forelimb, p = 0.0332 and right forelimb, p = 0.0133) post-SCI. Conclusion Our results show that the forelimbs SSEP signals from the two groups of injuries with and without hypothermia have statistically significant differences on days 4 and 7. This indicates the neuroprotective effect of early hypothermia and its influences on stimulating further the neuroplasticity within the upper limbs neural network post-SCI. Timely detection of neuroplasticity and identifying the endogenous and exogenous factors have clinical applications in planning a more effective rehabilitation and functional electrical stimulation (FES) interventions in SCI patients."

    "abstract": "Mental stress is a common problem that affects individuals all over the world. Stress reduces human functionality during routine work and may lead to severe health defects. Early detection of stress is important for preventing diseases and other negative health-related consequences of stress. Several neuroimaging techniques have been utilized to assess mental stress, however, due to its ease of use, robustness, and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used. This paper aims to fill a knowledge gap by reviewing the different EEG-related deep learning algorithms with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for the evaluation of mental stress. The review focuses on data representation, individual deep neural network model architectures, hybrid models, and results amongst others. The contributions of the paper address important issues such as data representation and model architectures. Out of all reviewed papers, 67% used CNN, 9% LSTM, and 24% hybrid models. Based on the reviewed literature, we found that dataset size and different representations contributed to the performance of the proposed networks. Raw EEG data produced classification accuracy around 62% while using spectral and topographical representation produced up to 88%. Nevertheless, the roles of generalizability across different deep learning models and individual differences remain key areas of inquiry. The review encourages the exploration of innovative avenues, such as EEG data image representations concurrently with graph convolutional neural networks (GCN), to mitigate the impact of inter-subject variability. This novel approach not only allows us to harmonize structural nuances within the data but also facilitates the integration of temporal dynamics, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of mental stress levels."

With this in mind, we recruited 24 healthy subjects. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used for brain imaging while the subjects performed a series of finger tapping tasks using each of the five fingers individually. From average hemodynamic results, the middle finger tapping task showed a maximum amount of activation in the motor cortex, whereas the index finger tapping task had the minimum activation compared with the other four fingers. The little finger and ring finger tapping tasks gave the most significant and widespread activation, respectively, when compared through brain activation maps. The activation was clustered on a single region for the thumb tapping task, whereas a wider area showed a very strong activation for the little finger and ring finger tapping tasks. Conclusively, this study is a step toward standardizing finger tapping and its related motor area activations, demonstrating that little finger tapping can best suit the purpose of a finger tapping task for BCI and medical imaging applications."

However, accurately localizing STN region during DBS surgery remains a challenging task. Microelectrode recording (MER) is used to identify STN by neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, manual interpretation of STN functional activity might prompt false alarms. Although the existing technology based on deep learning (DL) can outline the STN anatomical borders, it suffers from computational complexity and skewed findings. An end-to-end attention-based lightweight model with residual connections and soft thresholding is designed specifically for STN region detection. Scalogram and spectrogram images are generated from MER to mimic the observation of neurosurgeons and gather contextual information in a more intuitive manner. Proposed model exhibits a simplified architecture with only 15 layers, distinguishing it from previous DL models that tend to be more complex. Spatial attention helped to focus on relevant patterns within the data, while residual connections enhanced the gradient flow throughout the developed network. Soft thresholding offered noise reduction and robustness to signal variability. This approach eliminated the requirement for excessively deep layers and the necessity for separate feature extraction and classification stages by integrating them into a single pipeline. Our model identified STN with an accuracy of 97.42%. Proposed model outperformed 15 existing cutting-edge techniques. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of lightweight DL framework to achieve precise STN localization. The proposed method has significant potential in improving the efficiency of DBS surgery by reducing reliance on the neurosurgeon experience."

Commercialized systems that are used to detect stress with EEGs require a controlled environment with many channels, which prohibits their daily use. Fortunately, there is a rise in the utilization of wearable devices for stress monitoring, offering more flexibility. In this paper, we developed a wearable monitoring system that integrates both EEGs and GSR. The novelty of our proposed device is that it only requires one channel to acquire both physiological signals. Through sensor fusion, we achieved an improved accuracy, lower cost, and improved ease of use. We tested the proposed system experimentally on twenty human subjects. We estimated the power spectrum of the EEG signals and utilized five machine learning classifiers to differentiate between two levels of mental stress. Furthermore, we investigated the optimum electrode location on the scalp when using only one channel. Our results demonstrate the system’s capability to classify two levels of mental stress with a maximum accuracy of 70.3% when using EEGs alone and 84.6% when using fused EEG and GSR data. This paper shows that stress detection is reliable using only one channel on the prefrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal regions of the brain."

We explore how different DL methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used to diagnose types of dementia such as Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. We also discuss the difficulties of using DL for diagnosing dementia, like the lack of large and varied datasets and the challenge of applying models to different groups of people. These issues indicate the need for more dependable and understandable models that consider a wide range of patient characteristics and biomarkers. Longitudinal studies are also needed to understand how the disease progresses and how treatments work. Collaboration among researchers, doctors, and data scientists is crucial to ensure DL models are scientifically sound and effective in clinical settings.

The aim of this paper was to develop a new method for estimating muscle forces from experimental kinematic data. The original method calculates muscle forces using the conventional numerical optimization by including physiological muscle properties. Then, the muscle forces estimated by the physiological optimization method (PO) were compared with those found by a traditional static optimization method (SO). In both optimization problems, muscle forces of the upper limb were estimated by minimizing a specific performance criterion. Although the muscles were treated as ideal force generators in the traditional method, they were constrained by their force–length and force–velocity relationships in the physiological method. Experimental methods to validate mathematical approach are limited. In the present study, we have chosen the EMG-to-force approach as a reference method with which to compare both numerical optimization results during a pointing task. The findings suggest that the physiological optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during pointing task than traditional static optimization. Muscle forces from PO method were well matched with those from the EMG-to-force validation method, for flexors elbow muscles (BIC, BRA and BRD), as well as for main flexors shoulder (Coracobrachialis and Deltoid Anterior). In addition, the PO model predicted extensors muscle function for Triceps long in the elbow joint, and for Deltoid Posterior and Latissimus dorsi in the shoulder joint. However, SO solutions showed little or no recruitment of extensors muscles which are the Triceps long and the Latissimus dorsi, and preferentially activated flexors muscles with large moment arms."

MEP monitoring and BBB examinations are conducted at baseline and weekly for eight weeks post-injury. Results: The results indicate that the relative MEP power spectral decreased to 11% and 22% in the left and right hindlimbs, respectively, during the first week post-SCI. In the second week, a slight spontaneous recovery was observed, reaching 17% in the left and 31% in the right hindlimbs. Over the following four weeks post-SCI, continuing deterioration of MEP signal power was observed with no detectable recovery. Conclusions: SCI attenuates hindlimb MEP power spectral and reduces locomotion, though the changes in MEP and locomotion exhibit distinct temporal patterns. The MEP monitoring provides valuable insights into the functional integrity of motor pathways following SCI and offer a sensitive and reliable assessment.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a crucial role as biomarkers of brain activity, providing valuable insights into neural processes. The spatial resolution of EEG, determined by the number of channels, is essential for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of brain functions. However, low-resolution EEG systems pose a significant challenge in capturing detailed brain processes. In this paper we propose a deep autoencoder structure that essentially takes in the information from low resolution (LR) 32 channels of EEG and outputs a super-resolution (SR) 63 channel EEG signal. Our proposed approach, draws its inspiration from image super-resolution literature, and greatly improves on traditional interpolation approaches such as bilinear interpolation, with a 74.69% reduction in mean-squared error (MSE), 27.70% increase in correlation, and 25.19% increase in peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) ratio. Furthermore, the resulting LR, SR, and original high resolution (HR) signals were used within a Naive Bayes for deepfake classification; this yielded similar SR and HR classification results (61.13% and 62.21%, respectively), whereas the LR classification lagged behind both, with an average accuracy of 58.35%. This serves as a proof-of-concept for generating higher resolution EEG from low resolution data to channels as high as 63 with a simple autoencoder based structure, with application to deepfake detection."

Various machine learning techniques play an important role in this regard. However, when working with a small number of study participants, the lack of sufficient data and achieving meaningful classification results remain a challenge. In this study, we employ a classification strategy to explore stress and its impact on spatial activation patterns and brain connectivity caused by the Stroop color–word task (SCWT). To improve our results and increase our dataset, we use data augmentation with a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The study is carried out at two separate times of day (morning and evening) and involves 21 healthy participants. Additionally, we introduce binaural beats (BBs) stimulation to investigate its potential for stress reduction. The morning session includes a control phase with 10 SCWT trials, whereas the afternoon session is divided into three phases: stress, mitigation (with 16 Hz BB stimulation), and post-mitigation, each with 10 SCWT trials. For a comprehensive evaluation, the acquired fNIRS data are classified using a variety of machine-learning approaches. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed a maximum accuracy of 60%, whereas non-augmented data classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN) provided the highest classification accuracy of 73%. Notably, after augmenting the data with DCGAN, the classification accuracy increases dramatically to 96%. In the time series data, statistically significant differences were noticed in the data before and after BB stimulation, which showed an improvement in the brain state, in line with the classification results. These findings illustrate the ability to detect changes in brain states with high accuracy using fNIRS, underline the need for larger datasets, and demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly help when data are scarce in the case of brain signals."

Our study proposes using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with multiple machine learning models to assess the level of mental stress. Objective: The objective is to identify and quantify stress levels during 240 days confinement scenario. In this study, we utilize a diverse set of stress indicators including salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels, reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, and power spectral density (PSD), in conjunction with functional connectivity networks (FCN). We estimate the PSD using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the FCN using partial directed coherence. Results: Our findings reveal several intriguing insights. The sAA levels increased from the first 30 days in confinement to the culmination of the lengthy 240-day mission, suggesting a cumulative impact of stress. Conversely, RT and the accuracy of target detection exhibit significant fluctuations over the course of the mission. The power spectral density shows a significant increase with time-in-mission across all participants in most of the frontal area. The FCN shows a significant decrease in most of the right frontal areas. Five different machine learning classifiers are employed to differentiate between two levels of stress resulting in impressive classification accuracy rates: 96.44% with-nearest neighbor (KNN), 95.52% with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), 88.71% with Naïve Bayes (NB), 87.41 with decision trees (DT) and 96.48% with Support Vector Machine (SVM).

This study, therefore, intends to build on the theory to classify the most significant criteria that underpin the ‘Smart Campus’ by considering the institute’s stakeholders’ perceptions. A multi-step methodological approach is adopted to develop a decision support tool that allows the decision makers to invest in the optimum solution to transform a traditional campus into a smart campus. The study initially looks into the criteria and sub-criteria from the literature that defines a ‘Smart Campus’. Secondly, a survey was conducted by targeting a sample of students, faculty, administrative staff, and IT support personnel from a leading institute in the UAE region as a single case study. Thirdly, an AHP analysis was performed among different stakeholders. The findings suggested that there exists a consensus among the perception of a diverse group of participants who perceive smart security and safety, campus navigation, and adaptive learning as the most important criteria and applications to transform the traditional campus into a smart campus.

Private hospitals operate in a competitive environment, relying on quality for survival. To gain a competitive edge, healthcare facilities prioritize high-quality care, leading to the adoption of Industry 4.0 advancements for improved service efficiency. However, the implementation of Industry 4.0 driven technologies has impacted the service quality in healthcare. As such, the capability of the healthcare system to provide the required results should be assessed based on its impact on the quality of services in HC4.0 (Healthcare 4.0). Therefore, with the evidence of the effect of HC4.0 on service quality, the current service quality models do not efficiently assess service quality in healthcare. This highlights the necessity for evaluating healthcare service quality in HC4.0, while considering the technological advancements to bridge the service quality gap. Thus, the purpose of this research is to define the underpinning criteria to guide the assessment of service quality in HC4.0 based on the review and understanding of healthcare service quality and the evolution of healthcare.

    "abstract": "Lightweight concrete has proven effective material due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, cost-effectiveness, improved sound insulation, and fire resistance. However, there is scarce data on the confinement behaviour of the lightweight concrete (LWC) exposed to elevated temperatures, particularly when wrapped with fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP). This study explores the behaviour of LWC strengthened and repaired with carbon FRP (CFRP) laminates tested under elevated temperatures. LWC specimens wrapped with CFRP laminates are tested experimentally under temperatures varying from 20 °C to 800 °C. Parameters like compressive strength, stress-strain behaviour, elastic modulus, and failure modes are evaluated as a function of increasing temperature. Analytical models are developed to estimate the degradation on compressive strength and elastic modulus with temperature and validated against experimental data. The outcomes from this study support the use of CFRP wraps to partially restore the strength and elasticity in LWC compression members at moderate temperatures, enhancing its resilience in fire-prone applications."

Additionally, due to its requirement for high data throughput, the system will operate in the millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency range as this would allow for large bandwidths. Due to this frequency range as well as its potential operation in industrial applications, techniques to help mitigate any drawbacks were explored. The use of the noisecancelling technique was identified as a suitable one, as its improvement in the noise performance of the receiver system can ensure that a communication link can be reliably maintained. The literature review first identified designed LNAs for other related wireless communication technologies, such as previous generations of Wi-Fi and WiGig to understand the requirements needed for such a system. Next, a review of LNAs designed to operate in the mm-wave were conducted to help understand the effects encountered in this range as well as any useful techniques. Finally, a review of noise-cancelling LNAs designed in the mm wave and for wireless communication purposes was performed for similar reasons.

The effect of addition 3D and 5D steel fiber and synthetic fiber to concrete mixes as a single or hybrid with 0.75 vol of fraction was studied. Twelve rectangular beams with a/d ratio of 3.1 and without shear reinforcement were cast, tested, and evaluated. The partial replacement of LWA with NWA resulted in slight decrease in concrete compressive strength while the flexural strength and shear performance enhanced. The main alterations observed from the incorporation of fibers were the increase of shear strength, stiffness and deformability, and improved cracking patterns. The increase in ultimate shear strength ranged from 91 % to 137 % with reference to the control beams. The percentage of improvement was affected by fiber type, hybrid fiber (5D steel + synthetic) reinforced mix had the best performance in shear capacity. Furthermore, the experimental results were compared to design codes. The Canadian code followed by the ACI code is better matching the experimental results of shear capacity compared to the Euro code 2. Furthermore, for fiber reinforced concrete mixes, an average modification factor 1.98, 1.75, and 2.06 is recommended when using steel fibers, synthetic fibers, and hybrid fibers (50 % steel+50 % synthetic); respectively, for the ACI, Canadian, Euro code 2 equations."

The review begins with an overview of LPBF-AM technology, followed by a discussion of CNT structures and properties, providing the necessary background. Current research on incorporating CNTs into metals such as titanium, copper, stainless steel, nickel, and aluminum for LPBF-AM is explored. These studies demonstrate improvements in hardness, strength, laser absorptivity, and defect reduction, primarily attributed to in situ carbide formation and the hindrance of dislocation movement. However, maximizing the potential of CNTs in this context requires overcoming specific challenges, such as ensuring homogeneous dispersion, enhancing interfacial bonding, and maintaining high-temperature stability during the LPBF process. This review also addresses these challenges, focusing on research gaps, such as porosity/defect control, laser–matter interactions, and the relationship between microstructure and properties. Finally, emerging application domains in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, and electronic systems are discussed, positioning CNT-reinforced LPBF-AM as a frontier for next-generation multifunctional materials and advanced manufacturing technologies. These applications are driven by the exceptional mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of CNT/metal composites.

The compatibility equation and the Airy stress function are used to eliminate of axial displacements from the governing equations and end up with two governing equations. Galerkin’s method is used to discretize the equations of motion where three modes are retained in the discretization. The Newton–Raphson method is used to solve the set of nonlinearly coupled algebraic equations for the equilibrium paths and the Jacobian method is used to assess their stability. The influence of the layups, thickness, radii of curvature ratio and the radius of curvature to side length ratio on the static bending, snapthrough, reverse snapthrough, and the bistability region of doubly curved shallow shells is examined.

    "abstract": "Gas sensors have been increasingly employed in a wide range of applications such as air quality monitoring, disease diagnosis, potential leakage of exhaust gases in industrial facilities, and food quality control. We propose a novel MEMS gas sensor made of two mechanically-coupled microbeams coated with metal organic frameworks and subject to electric actuation. The objective is to exploit the dynamic features of the microstructure to simultaneously detect the presence of two gases, namely carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) and methane (CH<inf>4</inf>), and estimate their concentrations. A nonlinear mathematical model of the gas sensor is developed and verified in the nonlinear operating regime against experiments reported in the literature. Deep learning methods are integrated with the sensor's model to predict the gases’ characteristics from the dynamic features of the coupled microbeams. To do so, we generate a large set of dynamic responses of the sensor for varying operating conditions and use it to train deep neural networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies in the data. The results show evidence of high prediction accuracy in terms of gas type and concentration estimation. The optimal accuracy is achieved when all dynamic features of the two coupled beams are used as inputs. These include the first six natural frequencies, the RMS, minimum, and maximum values of the dynamic response of the coupled microbeams when actuated by a combination of DC and AC voltages near the veering point. Yet, the use of the dynamic features of one of the two microbeams is found to still predict the concentrations of both gases with a good accuracy level. As such, one can deploy one beam for actuation and the other beam for sensing both gases thanks to their mechanical coupling. We also compare our results to those obtained from classical statistical approaches, namely linear regression and support vector regression. The neural network based approach outperforms these two classical methods, especially when a limited number of data features is used as input."

A finite element model is developed to predict the wrinkling behavior of the membrane. An experimental setup equipped with 3D digital image correlation system is used to determine the wrinkles pattern, amplitude, and wavelength. Symmetric circular holes are introduced in the membrane to redistribute the stress field, eliminate the fluctuation in the minor principal stress in the membrane, and suppress wrinkles.

Through the careful selection of constituent elements along with optimized thermal processing for proper control of structure, grain size, and deformation mechanisms, many of the newly developed HEA systems exhibit superior strength and ductility levels across a wide range of temperatures, particularly at cryogenic deformation temperatures. Such a remarkable response has been attributed to the hardening capacity of many MPEAs that is achieved through the activation of deformation twinning. More recent compositions have considered phase transforming systems, which have the potential for enhanced strengthening and therefore high strength and ductility levels. However, the strain rate sensitivity of such transforming MPEAs is not well understood and requires further investigation. In this study, the tensile properties of the non-equiatomic V<inf>10</inf>Cr<inf>10</inf>Fe<inf>45</inf>Co<inf>30</inf>Ni<inf>5</inf> MPEA were investigated at different deformation rates and temperatures ranging from 77 K (−196 °C) to 573 K (300 °C). Depending on the deformation temperature, the considered MPEA exhibits plasticity through either crystallographic slip, deformation twinning, or solid-state phase transformation. At 300 °C, only slip-mediated plasticity was observed for all the considered deformation rates. Deformation twinning was detected in samples deformed at room temperature, while face-centered cubic to body-centered cubic phase transformation became more favorable at cryogenic deformation temperatures. The trends are nonlinear with twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) favored at the intermediate deformation rate, while transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) was observed, although limited, only at the slowest deformation rate. For all the considered deformation rates at cryogenic deformation temperature, a significant TRIP activity was always detected. The extent of TRIP, however, was dependent on the deformation rate. Increasing the deformation rate is not conducive to TRIP and thus hinders the hardening capacity."

Ideally, this process needs to be performed without damaging the sample and at low-cost, while obtaining high-accurate results.

The proposed method is based on passing Wi-Fi signals through the observed samples, then analyzing the Channel State Information (CSI) magnitude and phase components. The collected CSI data packets are pre-processed by performing an averaging operation. Then, the resulting data are divided into training and validation sets and used to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here, the trained CNN models are formulated either as classifiers or regression models, depending on the material under test. If the objective is to sort materials within specific classes, then the CNN is formulated as a classifier. Alternatively, if the goal is to estimate a continuously varying parameter in a material, then the CNN is formulated as a regression model. Furthermore, as per the collected data, the proposed method is used to identify the construction materials based on their thickness, water content value (moisture), and compaction. The obtained experimental results effectively demonstrate the potential and merits of the proposed method. Overall, the trained CNN models achieved a 100% validation accuracy and a low validation loss, which confirms that the method is valid and highly accurate."

The sensors are made of fixed–fixed microbeams with an actuation electrode extending over one-half of the beam span in order to maximize the actuation of asymmetry. A nonlinear dynamic reduced-order model of the sensor is first developed and validated. It is then deployed to investigate the design of sensors that exploit the spatially complex and dynamically rich motions that arise due to veering and modal hybridization between the first symmetric and the first anti-symmetric modes of the beam. Specifically, we compare among the performance of four sensors implemented on a common platform using four detection mechanisms: classical frequency shift, conventional bifurcation, modal ratio, and differential capacitance. We find that frequency shift and conventional bifurcation sensors have comparable sensitivities. On the other hand, modal interactions within the veering range and modal hybridization beyond it offer opportunities for enhancing the sensitivity and SNR of bifurcation-based sensors. One method to achieve that is to use the modal ratio between the capacitances attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric modes as a detector, which increases the detection signal by three orders of magnitude compared to a conventional bifurcation sensor. We also present a novel sensing mechanism that exploits a rigid arm extending transversely from the arch beam mid-point and placed at equal distances between two side electrodes. It uses the asymmetry of the arch beam motions to induce rotary motions and realize a differential sensor. It is found to increase the detection signal by two orders of magnitude compared to a conventional bifurcation sensor."

Properties such as a light weight, high specific strength, and design flexibility along with the low manufacturing costs of metal–polymer hybrid structures make them widely attractive in several applications. One of the main challenges that hinders the widespread utilization of metal–polymer hybrid structures is the challenging dissimilar joining of metals to polymers. Friction stir welding (FSW) shows a promising potential in overcoming most of the issues and limitations faced in the conventional joining methods of such structures. Several works in the literature have explored the FSW of different metal-to-polymer combinations. In some of the works, the joints are examined based on processing parameter optimization, microstructural characteristics, and mechanical performances. It is, therefore, important to summarize the findings of these works as a means of providing a reference to researchers to facilitate further research on the utilization of FSW in joining metals to polymers. Thus, this work aims to present a comprehensive technical review on the FSW technique for joining metals to polymers by reviewing the reported literature findings on the impact of materials, tools, process parameters, and defects on the strength and microstructure of the produced joints.

These hybrid foams integrate commercially available metallic foams or cellular metallic solids with metallic coatings of different constituents and thicknesses to realize tailored elastic, yield, and thermal properties that can satisfy the needs of a wide range of multifunctional applications. This work aims to explore the range of tailored properties that can be obtained using a hybrid foam system that comprises copper coatings and the widely available aluminum open-cell foams. The elastic, plastic, and thermal conductive properties of the considered hybrid foam system are determined using computational tools for a range of porosities and coating thicknesses. Results show that the hybrid foam system can deliver significantly higher stiffness, yield strength, and thermal conductivity than its aluminum foam substrate. In few of the studied configurations, the stiffness and thermal conductivity of the hybrid foam system exceeded those of its aluminum foam substrate by more than 100%. Relative improvement in the hybrid foam properties correlated nonlinearly with the porosity of its aluminum foam substrate. Semi-empirical models were developed to predict the properties of hybrid coated open-cell foams. These models can assist engineers in selecting the hybrid foam parameters, such as coating constituent material and thickness, needed to obtain tailored elastic, yield strength, and thermal conductivity."

The objective is first to demonstrate its feasibility at the macroscale, develop and validate an FEM model at the macroscale and then scale down the FEM model to verify the possible implementation of the mechanism at the microscale. The sensing approach relies on a mechanical compliant mechanism that amplifies the thermal expansion of a structure. A testing platform equipped with an IR thermometer, thermocouple, a power supply, and laser distance sensors, is implemented to demonstrate the operability of the proposed sensing mechanism. A numerical model of the sensor is developed using the FE software Ansys. The numerical results show a good agreement with their experimental counterparts at the macro scale. The model is then used to numerically investigate several configurations, namely single, double, triple and quadruple compliant mechanisms. The amplification factor is found the highest when using the double compliant mechanism. A temperature sensitivity of 28.5 μm/°C is achieved for this compliant mechanism. The numerical analysis also demonstrated that the performance obtained at the macro scale, can be conserved for microscale devices. However, buckling of some elements is observed for the microscale system which degrades the performance of the sensor when subjected to relatively large displacements. The microscale FEM model shows the possible prevention of buckling issues by slightly modifying the geometry of the compliant mechanisms. The present study is expected to provide baseline and guidance for the implementation of the sensing approach for MEMS devices."

    "abstract": "The use of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) composite materials in strengthening applications of reinforced concrete (RC) structures has been gaining wide popularity in recent decades. This is due to its superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, durability, and versatility. In fact, it is well established that bonding FRP materials to the soffit of RC beams enhances the flexural capacity of such beams. However, the non-yielding characteristic of FRP materials is a major concern, and often results in sudden and brittle failure mode of the strengthened member. To encounter this issue, a new type of FRP materials composed from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers have been developed. Compared to conventional FRPs, PET-FRP have large deformability and possess a nonlinear stress-strain relationship. Employing PET-FRP in the retrofitting industry reduces construction waste, enhances the capacity of structures and provides a solution that encourages the concept of sustainability. However, these types of large rupture strain (LRS) FRPs have lower stiffness and tensile strengths than conventional FRPs. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to combine the lower stiffness and large rupture strain of PET-FRP sheets with that of the higher stiffness and strength of carbon FRP (CFRP) sheets resulting in a new hybrid composite system. The research program consists of four RC beams externally strengthened with CFRP, PET-FRP, and their hybrid combinations, in addition to a control unstrengthened beam specimen. The beams are tested under four-point bending and load-displacement curves along with the failure modes, strength, strain in the FRP, and ductility of the beam specimens are examined. Test results indicate that strengthening with PET-FRP laminates significantly enhances the deformation capacity of the strengthened specimens compared to that with CFRP. In addition, the hybrid mix between CFRP and PET-FRPs resulted in 46-48% strength improvement compared to the unstrengthened control beam. However, the effectiveness of the hybrid system was not pronounced in terms of ductility due to the premature debonding of the concrete cover that occurred before utilizing the full strain of the hybrid system. Hence, it is advised for future research studies to anchor the hybrid sheets by means of end U-wraps or FRP spike anchors to delay the debonding failure and to exploit the benefits of the proposed hybrid system."

Polyolefin fibre which is a polymeric produced from a simple olefin (CnH2n) was mixed with dry sand to investigate the improvement of shear strength and effect on volume changes. Specimens with 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% of fibre contents with different lengths (i.e. 15mm and 30mm) are prepared in repeatable steps and tested in direct shear tests. In addition, two sand types; coarse sand and fin sand were used in this investigation to study the grading size effects on the behaviour of the fiber-reinforced sand. Results indicated that, the inclusion of randomly distributed discrete fibres significantly improved the shear strength of sand. The existence of polymeric fibre inside the sand developed what is called apparent tensile cohesion in addition to the sand normal internal friction angle. The optimum fibre percentage for improving both friction angle and apparent tensile cohesion was about 1%. Adding fibre more than this ratio resulted in a significant reduction in both soil shear strength parameters. The effect of fibre on sand tensile cohesion is more pronounced compared to its effect on the friction angle. A bearing capacity of hypothetical footing resting on ground surface of fibre reinforced sand was estimated and discussed. Finally, quantitative effects of fibre contents on both shear strength and volume changes for sand are presented and discussed."

Although several parameters impact their performance, magnetic saliency has a significant impact. This paper presents a study on the influence of the saliency ratio on the performance of switched reluctance motors. A detailed design procedure for a mid-drive electric motor for a high-performance electric bike is presented. A systematic methodology is adopted to estimate the power rating for desired vehicle performance while considering the vehicle’s mechanical and aerodynamic parameters. Additionally, the paper discusses and analyzes the design of two SRM motor configurations with different rotor poles (6/4 and 6/10) while performing magnetostatic analysis for generated torque validation. A parametric study is performed on the 6/10 SRM design for further improvement in the torque profile while keeping the same fill factor and electrical loading. Furthermore, the transient analysis in Ansys Maxwell 2D for both SRMs confirms the designed performance. The results shows that the SRM with higher rotor poles (6/10) is a better choice."

    "abstract": "The advancement of high-power microwave technology has indeed brought about the possibility of E-bombs, also known as electromagnetic pulse (EMP) bombs. These weapons emit an electromagnetic pulse that can disable electrical circuitry within a specific radius. As the frequency spectrum becomes more congested with various technologies operating in similar frequency bands, the need for shielding against interference becomes crucial. One promising solution is the use of conductive concrete, which is created by incorporating conductive components into a traditional concrete mixture. This conductive concrete has shown excellent shielding properties and improved electrical characteristics. To assess and quantify its effectiveness, the relative complex permittivity of the concrete mixture needs to be estimated. In this paper, the authors propose a method for estimating the relative complex permittivity of the concrete mixture. This was achieved by measuring the scattering parameters of concrete samples using a rectangular waveguide within the C-band frequency range. The scattering parameters provide valuable information about how electromagnetic waves interact with the concrete. A dielectric mixing model was developed to determine the relative complex permittivity. This model takes into account the volume percentage and the dielectric properties of the individual constituents present in the concrete mixture. By applying this model and obtaining the complex permittivity of the mixture, it becomes possible to calculate the required thickness of the conductive concrete mix needed to achieve the desired levels of electromagnetic attenuation and shielding."

The surface preparation study shows that, compared to the other methods in this study, the shear key method is the most suitable surface preparation method to fully utilize the CC in a composite. Moreover, the casting direction study reveals that the strength is heavily dependent on the type of test used along with CC’s layer positioning. The flexural strength study confirms that positioning the CC mix in the tensile region is beneficial since it can increase the flexural strength of a structure because of the hybrid steel fibers included in the mixture. Finally, different codes/specifications and published theoretical results are used to predict the CC’s mechanical properties, and the predictions are not as accurate as the SCC predictions, which can be attributed to the presence of conductive fillers in the CC mix."

Pseudo-strain-hardening indices, multiple micro-cracking behaviours and self-healing properties were also tested. The experimental results reveal that, except for the 1 mm particle CF, incorporating CF could improve the strength (compression, tension and flexure) of ULW-ECCs but decrease the strain ductility properties under tension; and CF lengths of 9- and 12-mm show better results. The electrical conductivity of ULW-ECCs was improved by CF, and the higher dosage further increased the conductivity. The conductivity increased first and then decreased with the increase in CF length and the 9 mm CF (1.0 vol%) shows higher conductivity. The conductive network was affected by the volume fraction, length, count under the same content, and possible fracture of CF. Long CFs work well at low content in forming conductive networks, while short CFs are more effective at high content. The conductivity decreased with the increase of curing age and reached a constant value after 90 d. Incorporating CF and increasing its length/content negatively impacted crack number and width.

Further, lightweight concrete has recently emerged, contributing to the sustainable values of modern construction. Many researchers have worked on enhancing the concrete's compressive strength by applying externally bonding fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites via epoxy adhesives. Such FRP materials are very promising due to their lightweight and high tensile strength along with high corrosion, impact, and fatigue resistance. This paper aims to investigate the use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) wraps in enhancing concrete's compressive properties. The study is conducted on strengthened and control normal weight (NWC) and structural lightweight concrete (LWC) cylinders (150 mm x 300 mm). Experimental results show that CFRP wrapping increase the compressive strength and stiffness of both types of concrete. The compressive strength of structural LWC increased by 67.9% and 118.1%, compared to an increase of 46.1% and 105.0% for LWC, using one and two layers of CFRP, respectively. Further, the ductility is significantly enhanced with CFRP wrapping, suggesting increased resilience and ability to absorb energy during deformation. In terms of behavior at failure, LWC exhibited a more favourable response than NWC at failure. Results indicate that LWC has a satisfactory performance in withstanding compressive loads. This underscores the potential for lightweight concrete to serve as a viable structural material and highlights the role of CFRP reinforcement in further elevating its structural capabilities."

Additionally, the suggested detection mechanism allows for overcoming the inherent parasitic capacitance, thereby mitigating low signal-to-noise ratios."

    "abstract": "Concrete is one of the most versatile and commonly used composite materials in construction, with its properties being influenced by the type and proportion of materials used in its mixing process. Ensuring accurate mixing is crucial for a structure's durability and safety. Therefore, assessing concrete mixture quality, homogeneity, and composition post-hydration is vital to meet application requirements. This study proposes a novel non-destructive approach for concrete classification, focusing on homogeneity, conductivity, and composition analysis in dry concrete mixtures. The proposed technique is based on analyzing changes to Wi-Fi signals that are radiated through concrete specimens. These variations are in the form of changes to the magnitude and phase of the Wi-Fi's Channel State Information (CSI). These data are then utilized to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers for concrete mixture categorization. The proposed method successfully estimates homogeneity across concrete samples with varied particle sizes and achieves a 100% validation accuracy in estimating conductivity and composition. Additionally, distinct CSI responses are observed for mixtures with differing compositions. The validation experiments with new concrete samples demonstrate the models’ robustness and generalization capability, achieving a 78.18% correct prediction rate despite variations in dimensions and compositions. While the models exhibit high accuracy in detecting certain materials, such as silica fume and fly ash, NW aggregates, and steel fiber, challenges persist in detecting materials like carbon powder due to potential confusion with other conductive materials. Overall, the trained CNN models demonstrate strong generalization ability and robustness, highlighting their potential for accurate concrete property detection in various scenarios."

While hydrofluoroolefin blowing agents have been used previously to prepare polyurethane foams, few studies have been reported on their use in phenolic foams. We introduce an effective method for foam preparation using two low-boiling blowing agents, cis-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene and trans-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene, and their combinations with hexane. Traditionally, phenolic foams have been prepared using chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which can have harmful effects on the environment due to their high ozone depletion potential or global warming potential. Conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) modeling studies were performed to understand the effects of different blowing agent combinations on their boiling points. A series of phenolic foams were prepared by varying the concentration of the hydrofluoroolefin and the hydrofluoroolefin–hexane blowing agent combinations. The concentrations of the surfactant, Agnique CSO 30, and the toughening agent, polyethylene glycol, were also varied to yield a formulation with the optimal properties. The foams formulated with the hydrofluoroolefin–hexane mixture displayed a higher compressive strength and a lower thermal conductivity than those prepared with either hydrofluoroolefin or hexane alone. The cell microstructure of all the foams was examined using scanning electron microscopy. By introducing flexible chains into the resin matrix, PEG facilitates proper distribution of hydrofluoroolefin–hexane blowing agents and other reagents and thereby increases the mechanical strength of the foam."

The experimental results show that recycling ETTS to partially replace cement reduced the generation of portlandite (CH), hydrate calcium silicate (C-S-H) and ettringite (AFt) in the ECC matrix, moreover, the microstructures of ECC matrix was also coarsened, both of the above likely against the gaining of strength of ECC, such as the compressive and tensile strength of ECC were decreased from 88.9 MPa to 10.54 MPa in reference ECC (T0) to 75.6 MPa and 9.25 MPa as the replacement ratio up to 30 %, respectively. In addition, the X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the ETTS-ECC mixture exhibits diffraction peaks of Friedel's salt, indicating that the hydration products in the matrix have a chemical adsorption effect on chloride ions. Moreover, the tensile strain capacity of ECC was significantly improved to 5.69–6.65 % from 2.81 % in T0 upon the ETTS incorporating, meanwhile, the average width of cracks in ECC was narrowed from 92.8 μm to 74.6 μm.

Methodology: The inlet-filled thermal entrance region model addresses the Graetz–Brinkman problem of viscous dissipation in developing heat transfer in a tube subject to a constant heat flux at the wall, considering Newtonian, pseudoplastic, and dilatant fluids. The inlet-filled region concept is used to solve for developing heat transfer, with the thermal entrance region divided into a thermal boundary layer zone, called the thermal inlet region, ending at the point where the thermal boundary layer fills the whole tube cross section, followed by a thermally filled region where fully developed conditions are asymptotically reached. Key Results: The model is essentially analytical. The results include profiles of the dimensionless thermal boundary layer thickness, Nusselt number, dimensionless bulk, wall and centerline temperatures, and entrance region length for different values of the Brinkman number and power-law index, with validation against the derived fully developed solution and published results.

    "abstract": "This work predicts the temperature ranges for dynamic strain aging (DSA) activation in C45 steel at various strain rates through constitutive modeling and finite element (FE) simulations. DSA is often defined by a sudden increase in a metal’s strength when subjected to specific combinations of strain rates and temperatures due to the interaction of the diffused solute atoms with dislocations, and there is currently no effective constitutive model in the literature that can explain DSA physically. The current study offers a modification to the Voyiadjis–Abed (VA) model, which is used to predict DSA activation in C45 steel, in order to address this limitation. The modified constitutive model considers the diffusion kinetics and concentration of solute atom along the dislocation cores. The developed model was able to capture the activation of DSA in C45 steel at strain rates of 0.0015/s-0.15/s and temperature ranges of 500 K-750 K, which was found to be caused by carbon solute atoms. Additionally, FE simulations were carried out in ABAQUS through subroutine coded as VUMAT to validate the modified VA model’s prediction abilities. The results obtained compare effectively with the available experimental data. By integrating physical and microstructural features, the modified constitutive VA model can effectively capture the increase in flow stress due to the activation of DSA. This enables further investigation and progress in understanding the behavior of metals under specified temperature and strain rate conditions."

The leading flag is subjected to both streamlined and vortex-induced flows (VIFs). Wind tunnel experiments reveal a subcritical bifurcation route to limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) under streamlined flow, while VIF alters the bifurcation to a supercritical route. First, the identical flags with a natural frequency of 3.59 Hz (first bending mode) and a flutter speed near 7.4 m/s are tested in tandem under streamlined flow. The leading flag's dynamics remains largely unchanged compared to its standalone dynamics, while the trailing flag's response is highly sensitive to its position in the wake of the leading flag. Phase dynamics, including frequency locking and bounded phase differences, emerges at different flow regimes depicting synergistic and destructive coherence. For closely spaced flags ( G f = 0.1L), trailing flag LCO amplitudes are suppressed by up to 50%, while at larger gaps, amplitudes increase by up to 1.5 times. For a non-identical trailing flag with much higher natural frequency (5.48 Hz) and flutter onset speed ( U > 9.0 m/s), the flutter onset is advanced and matches that of the leading flag. The non-identical trailing flag oscillates close to its natural dynamics across a wide range of inter-flag gaps and flow speeds but exhibits small-amplitude LCOs driven by the leading flag at very low speeds. Finally, the identical tandem flags are placed downstream of a cylindrical bluff body to examine the impact of VIF conditions. Small-amplitude aperiodic oscillations are observed in the leading flag much below its critical flutter speed, which, in turn, induce a sufficiently strong wake to trigger LCOs in the trailing flag. The leading flag dynamics transitions to periodic oscillations at higher speeds, while the trailing flag exhibits strongly aperiodic oscillations, with one frequency locked to that of the leading flag. The comprehensive nonlinear aeroelastic analysis of tandem flags presented in the study can be utilized for enhancing multi-flag energy harvesting, fluid mixing, and heat transfer."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the nonlinear vibration of thermally induced bistable cantilever symmetric laminates under harmonic excitations using a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model. The model is validated by ABAQUS finite element (FE) package and is able to predict the single-well vibration as well as the double-well snapthrough response. Bistable laminates have two stable equilibrium positions at room temperature due to the thermal mismatch upon cooling. It has been proven that thin unsymmetric laminates lose their bistability when clamped or attached to a larger structure. The hybrid bistable symmetric laminates (HBSL) with initially aluminum plies and later bi-directional (BD) glass–epoxy plies resolved this issue. The later layup is called modified hybrid bistable symmetric laminates (m-HBSL). The laminate is subjected to a tip harmonic excitation whose frequency is tuned at the first bending mode to drive the laminate at resonance. The method of multiple-time scales is used to find an approximate analytical solution and the amplitude and phase modulation equations for the small vibration in the vicinity of one of the equilibrium positions. For the steady-state response, the frequency-response plots are obtained and the laminate’s effective nonlinearity was found to be of softening type. Using the numerical integration of the equation of motion, it is found that at low excitation amplitudes, the laminate possesses a single-well periodic response around either well of the static equilibrium positions. As the forcing amplitude increases, the laminate experiences a period-doubling bifurcation that leads to a chaotic single-well and double-well, snapthrough, response. Upon increasing the load further, a periodic snapthrough response is obtained. The main finding of this work is that the cantilevered bistable laminates dynamically snap at substantially reduced loads compared with their static counterparts when they are harmonically excited. Namely, the laminate snaps at a resonant harmonic load that is about 80% of its static value. Given the softening nonlinear behavior, it was interesting to find that the laminate can snap at a pre-resonant load of about 60% of its static value. The novelty of this work is that it presents the snapthrough response of a cantilevered bistable symmetric laminate under harmonic excitation, which mimics the scenario in many real-life applications, using a SDOF model that is inspired and validated by the FE results."

Over the years, researchers have presented numerous solutions to this problem, which often yield varying results concerning maximum forces, deformations, and the residual state of the system during a severe loading condition. In addition, few of the available methods of analysis can explicitly consider the compaction-induced lateral force when the backfill is dry, sandy soil and the wall is closer to a source of vibration. In this research, a numerical model is developed and validated by experiments to study the transient and residual dynamic responses of non-yielding walls supporting over-consolidated sand. A numerical parametric study is conducted, considering the effects of backfill soil friction angle, soil over-consolidation ratio, and wall modulus of elasticity. The response of the soil–wall system is investigated by considering the maximum and residual deformation of the wall, distribution of lateral earth pressure, as well as the magnitude and location of the resultant earth force. The findings of this study show that the maximum transient and residual forces and deflections often considerably exceed the static values in non-yielding walls subjected to ground motions. In general, increasing the backfill friction angle increases the maximum deflection and force increments. A surge in the backfill over-consolidation ratio reduces the maximum and the residual deflection and force increments. Finally, increasing the panel wall elastic modulus lowers the maximum and residual deflection increments, raises the maximum force increments, and decreases residual force increments. Results from the study on residual strength can be useful for implementation in performance-based design procedures under extreme loading conditions."

Numerical simulations are conducted using a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver to analyze the vortex shedding mechanism from a circular bluff body and to assess its effect on a downstream slender body placed at different gap distances. Experiments on a low-speed wind tunnel are performed to examine the flow-induced flutter dynamics of thin flexible flags. Four different flag shapes, namely, triangular, square, rectangular, and trapezoidal, are tested both with and without an upstream bluff body. Under streamlined flow conditions, flutter instability is characterized by subcritical bifurcation routes, while the presence of a cylindrical bluff body induces supercritical bifurcation scenarios. The aeroelastic response of the flag is inspected while varying the gap distance, separating it from the cylindrical bluff body from 0.5 to 15 times the cylinder's diameter. Experimental results show that the shape of the flag significantly influences its dynamic behavior, especially when it is placed in close proximity to the bluff body. The triangular flag exhibits the highest limit cycle oscillation (LCO) amplitudes, while the square flag has the lowest flutter onset speed. A regime of period-2 LCOs is observed in the triangular flag configuration, which is not seen elsewhere. For flags positioned farther away, the dynamics resembles those observed under streamlined flow, due to the vortices weakening with the increasing gap size. Finally, a comparative analysis demonstrates the flow speed regimes of high-amplitude oscillations for different flag shapes and bluff body positions, which can be explored for low speed energy harvesting applications."

Recently developments are seeing more of the integration and use of these accelerators in datacenters. The efficient utilization of FPGAs within this context in cloud data centers is still an open research problem. In this work, we explore FPGAs characteristics and resources and discuss efficient means to implement accelerators using these resources. Specifically, we discuss a partitioning model that minimizes the number of idle resources in an FPGA field during partitioning. The proposed partitioning approach is modeled as an exact optimization problem; the model was validated using the CPLEX Optimization Tool. We report on initial results obtained and discuss possible future work."

The goal was to create models that can accurately predict OPC's strength using machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. Among these methods, Random Forest stood out as the most effective, significantly outperforming the other models. The dataset consisted of concrete samples with varying fly ash percentages and curing periods, with compressive strength as the target variable. Random Forest achieved the highest R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.7893 and the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 6.5392, indicating its superior performance in predicting compressive strength compared to simpler models. The model's ability to capture non-linear relationships made it well-suited to understanding the complex interactions between fly ash content, curing time, and strength.

Understanding and exploiting this coupling can improve the design process of applications utilizing cellular solids’ acoustic properties.

In particular, this work investigates the effect of the two main deformation mechanisms observed in cellular materials, i.e. bending and stretching, on the dispersive and direction dependent characteristics of 2D elastic waves traversing them. Two related honeycomb-based lattices are used in this work, namely a bending dominated lattice and a stretching dominated lattice. Results show that asymmetric waves in the bending dominated lattice are more direction dependent and less dispersive than in the stretching dominated lattice, whereas symmetric waves are generally independent of direction and dispersive in both bending and stretching dominated lattices. In addition, results show that phase velocities of symmetric and asymmetric waves scale linearly with relative density in the bending dominated lattice and nonlinearly with relative density in the stretching dominated lattice. Moreover, maximum phase velocities in the stretching dominated lattice are observed to be higher than in the bending dominated lattice."

    "abstract": "In statistical process monitoring, statistical control tools are used to identify deviations from normal operating conditions. In many industrial processes, such as batch production processes, multiple process variables must be monitored as they play a key role in the quality of the final product. Several monitoring tools are found in the literature that deal with the case of multiple process variables, but a few of them deal with the case of autocorrelated data. Existing tools that are used to monitor autocorrelated process variables have two main drawbacks. First, they are run offline. That is, monitoring is performed at the end of the production cycle and hence no corrective actions can be made. Second, these tools utilize dimensionality reduction techniques to solve for computational complexity issues. A Gaussian Process–based modeling approach is proposed in this work to monitor batch production processes online. The proposed monitoring approach takes into consideration of both the correlation between process variables and the within variable autocorrelations. A simulated and two real data sets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling approach. Model performance metrics showed that the proposed modeling approach has similar performance to the optimal case of Shewhart type control charts. Process status classification accuracy of about 92–98% were achieved for the cases considered."

The multidisciplinary nature of this inspection technology makes it rather difficult to theoretically capture the system response without the proper application of finite element methods (FEM). It requires relating the material mechanical and thermal properties in a coupled finite element model to properly address wave propagation, contact mechanics, fracture mechanics, friction heat generation and heat diffusion in simulated vibrothermography inspections. In this study, a theoretical model is developed to estimate the dynamic strain response at any location in commonly used cantilever beams oscillating at a given frequency. This model is utilized to assess the convergence of FEM dynamic system response while determining the element size requirements to realistically model elastic wave propagation throughout the sample. Three different meshing criteria are assessed to properly capture the singularity at the crack tip. It is demonstrated that the use of solid element circular meshing criteria around the crack tip converges to singular quarter-node solid element solution commonly used in fracture mechanics and allows coupling it with heat generation and diffusion around the vicinity of a crack to deliver a practical approach for modelling vibrothermography. This effort brings FEM a step closer towards realistic simulation of vibrothermography in the future."

The unsymmetric (Formula presented.) and the antisymmetric (Formula presented.) cross-ply laminates are investigated. Five key parameters are varied: the number of plies, the width-to-thickness ratio, the laminate’s aspect ratio, the ratio of the moduli of elasticity, and the ratio of the thermal expansion coefficients of the lamina. The laminate is assumed flat at the cured temperature and a uniform temperature gradient is applied until it is reduced to the room temperature. For each set of parameters, the stable equilibrium shapes of the laminate are obtained using a Ritz model. The ABAQUS finite element package is used to validate the model and an excellent agreement is obtained. Results that show the variation of the curvatures with the width-to-thickness ratio and the onset of the bistability for a variety of parameters are presented. The ratio of the moduli of elasticity and the thermal expansion coefficients significantly affect the critical width-to-thickness ratio at which the laminates become bistable. The unsymmetric laminates show bistability at a lower width-to-thickness ratio compared with the antisymmetric laminates. The results also show that the higher the aspect ratio, the lower the critical width-to-thickness ratio for stability for both laminates."

The results indicate that VT performance has a non-monotonic relation with all design parameters and, hence optimum performance can be achieved by conducting response surface methodology (RSM) study. The optimum VT performance is achieved with specific design parameters; for instance, the maximum cooling is achieved with VT length of 194 mm, VT diameter of 14.6 mm, 4 inlet nozzles, nozzle diameter of 1.8 mm, and hot outlet pressure of 60,303 Pa. The results show that energy separation increases at higher inlet pressures until inlet nozzles reach choking condition.

Numerous studies have shown that braces perform better against axial loads than conventional braces if inhibited from buckling with a restraining mechanism. This system is called Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs), enhancing energy dissipation when added to a structure. Contrary to the conventional BRBs, this paper presents testing a newly patented type of BRB system consisting of a stainless-steel core bar inserted into a buckling inhibiting unit made of mild steel pipe filled with grout and connected to a novel end restrained unit so-called fingers. The new system provides easy replacement of the core (dissipation unit) and end units if replacement is needed after a significant seismic event. Six BRB samples of three different cross-sections of core units were subjected to uniaxial cyclic loading following the AISC 341 qualification testing protocol. Only full-threaded core and smooth shaved core bars passed the qualification test out of three cross-sections. The successful tests showed a stable hysteretic response in the tension and compression phase of loading and a significant ductility of µ=4. Overall load-deformation responses, ductility, overall stiffness, and energy dissipation were analyzed and compared for the BRBs tests. The threaded cross-sectional type of core bar showed the highest energy dissipation and attained ductility compared to the other types of tested bars. A 3D NLFEA model of the best performing BRB specimen was created using the commercial software package ABAQUS. It exhibited notable agreement with the experimental results. The produced high-fidelity NLFEA models are a solid basis for a future more comprehensive parametric investigation campaign."

However, increasing the copper coating thickness beyond a certain range can reduce the foam's specific energy absorption due to increasing its mass. Based on the range of thickness used, it is found that a 50 μm thick coating allows for obtaining enhanced properties. At this thickness, the normalized plateau stress and energy absorption capacity per unit mass increase by 16% and 20%, respectively.

This encouraged designers to design wider and deeper register files with multiple read and write ports to increase their throughput. Nevertheless, larger register files consume higher energy/access, leak more power, and occupy larger areas on the chip. This portrays a significant issue in the field of chip design due to the limited energy resources in mobile devices that dominate today's market. Therefore, it becomes crucial for chip designers to devise new mechanisms that help them study the effect of increasing the register file capabilities on those characteristics at an early stage during the design process. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques, and with a reasonable degree of success have been used to predict the energy characteristics of a register file based on three parameters: The number of words in the file (D), the number of bits in one word (W) and the total number of Read and Write Ports (P). In this work, and using the same attributes, we attempt to predict the values of energy/access, leakage power, and occupied silicon area in register files using several machine learning algorithms to assess design alternatives and their energy and area tradeoffs. We compare our best algorithm to the ANN-based model reported in the literature using the same dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were able to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.991, 0.991, and 0.989 when predicting energy/access, leakage power, and silicon area, respectively. On the other hand, the designed artificial neural network (ANN) achieves correlation coefficients of 0.974, 0.982, and 0.987, while the closest algorithms in performance to SVM achieve 0.917, 0.980, and 0.987, respectively.

The main focus of this study is to develop correlations between Standard Penetration Test (SPT), Cone Penetration Tests (CPT), and shear wave velocity (Vs) measurements applicable to the compacted fills with high gravel content. More than fifty (50) SPT and similar number of CPT tests are performed on a large area of the island. A number of Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and Downhole Seismic (DHS) tests are conducted to measure the distribution of Vs with depth and imaging. The data is analyzed to develop correlations between SPT and CPT and between SPT and Vs. The proposed correlation between SPT and CPT generally does not agree with existing correlations for coarse grained soils. This study predicts larger values of tip resistance (q<inf>c</inf>) with N<inf>60</inf> values. The predicted Vs values as function of N<inf>60</inf>; however, are comparable with some prediction equations in the literature.

The model showed similarities in the softening effect of the DC voltage bias and an added mass when matching their induced shift in the natural frequency. As such, one can discern the inherent nonlinear effects of DC voltage bias on coupled resonators and exploit them for mass sensing applications without going over the hassle of mass deposition, which requires the deployment of complex processes.

Moreover, von Mises stress analysis was examined to understand the yield capability of the FGM plates in addition to the buckling modes that show the stress distribution of the critical buckling stress. Hence, this research provides a comprehensive analysis to display the relation between the critical buckling load and the arrangement of the circular cutouts. The results show that the critical buckling load heavily depends on the dimension of the plate and the cutout size. For instance, an increase in the plate thickness and a decrease in the cutout diameter increase the critical buckling load. Moreover, the circular cutout in a horizontal arrangement exhibited the best buckling performance, and as the arrangement shifts to a vertical arrangement, the buckling performance deteriorates."

The proposed method is based on modeling spindle motor current profile and using profile parameters to detect any major deviations from the average healthy state. Since several parameters are monitored simultaneously, multivariate statistical process control is utilized to flag deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated, using two data sets of two different materials, Al 6061 and Al-SiC metal matrix composite.

Multiplex electromechanical structures include multi-layered through-wall ultrasound power transfer (TWUPT) systems. Physical processes that support TWUPT include vibrations at a transmitting/acoustic source element, elastic wave propagation through a barrier and coupling layers, piezoelectric transduction of elastic vibrations at a receiving element, and spatial resonances of the transmitting and receiving elements. We investigate mode couplings in an optimized modal TWUPT system, including their physical origins, models used to describe them, and regimes of weak and strong couplings. The system layout optimization is defined in terms of size (volume), operating frequency, and matching circuit load optimization. A computational model is developed and utilized in conjunction with experimental modal characterization to highlight the impact of eigenmode features on optimization results. Several behavioral modes are identified and analyzed. The interaction of symmetric radial and asymmetric flexural modes causes the system damping to increase and the device's overall efficiency to decrease. The electromechanical coupling factor value is likewise reduced as a result of this. Such occurrences are explained by the flow of energy between modes as they interact.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a simple one-dimensional (1D) thermography technique to estimate a metallic alloy thermal diffusivity by employing a uniform flux-based heating source. A theoretical model is developed and validated to account for the sample dimensions, material thermal properties and the sample initial and boundary conditions. These conditions include the sample initial temperature, the effective convection heat transfer coefficient with the surrounding environment and the uniform heat flux supplied to the sample. The adopted theoretical model is tested against simulated thermal measurements to retrieve a sample unknown boundary conditions along with the material thermal diffusivity of interest following the Nelder-Mead optimization approach, which offers a high flexibility to the proposed technique. This technique is experimentally validated over a tempered aluminum alloy (Al-2024 T4) of relatively high thermal diffusivity and a one-order of magnitude lower thermal diffusivity annealed stainless-steel alloy (SS-304) delivering an uncertainty lower than 2 % in material thermal diffusivity estimation."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates experimentally the thermomechanical response of 42CrMo steel under several combinations of temperatures and strain-rate. To characterize the flow stress of this highstrength 42CrMo steel, two distinct test configurations were utilized. The first consisted of conventional uniaxial tensile tests conducted at room and elevated temperatures of 523<sup>◦</sup>K, 723<sup>◦</sup>K and 923<sup>◦</sup>K and three quasi-static strain-rates at 0.0015 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>, 0.015 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>, and 0.15 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>. The second test configuration was carried out under dynamic compression using a drop mass bench at room temperature with three different dynamic strain-rates of 300 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>, 400 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>, and 500 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>. Particular attention was paid to key features such as work-hardening (WH), grain size, dynamic strain aging (DSA), formation of microcavities, and their coupling with the influence of temperature/strain-rate combination. The dependence of 42CrMo steels’ flow stress on the quasi-static strain-rate at room temperature was almost insignificant. However, the strain-rate sensitivity increased with increasing temperatures. At high temperatures, different factors contributed to modifying the alloy microstructure which has a significant impact on the alloy’s mechanical properties. Quantification of the micro-cracks density and fractured specimens’ voids was established using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The Voyiadjis–Abed (VA) constitutive model was utilized in describing the flow stress of 42CrMo steels and implemented in the ABAQUS software to develop a robust finite element model capable of accurately simulating variant structural responses of 42CrMo steel alloy."

The data were collected from qualification testing of introduced BRBs per the AISC 341 test provision and finite element modeling. The BRB is made of three parts: core bar, restraining unit, and end units, in which duplicates of three different core bar cross sections (i.e., fully threaded, threaded notched, and smooth shaved) were tested. The BRBs introduced in this research come with innovative end parts, so-called fingers. These fingers provide the longitudinal gap required in every BRB system and simultaneously prevent buckling of the core bar at the end regions at both ends of the BRB sample, thus facilitating an easy core replacement if it gets damaged in the event of an earthquake. The measured parameters were the applied cyclic load and the corresponding displacement. Analysis of the acquired data illustrated an almost symmetric hysteric behavior with a little higher capacity under compression but a noticeable overall ductility of 4. Moreover, finite element modeling data for one type of core bar (fully threaded) were curated. The data presented in this paper will be valuable for fabricating BRBs in practice and further research on the topic considered. Dataset: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6795612.

They report that the Vs is practically unaffected by the strains, and the reasons behind this behavior are not fully understood. This study presents the continuous measurement of low-strain Vs with bender elements (BE) during monotonic shearing of two sand specimens in a triaxial device. The results are analyzed using a micro-mechanical model based on contact theory. The results of this study confirm that the Vs values from BE measurements are unaffected by an increase in axial strains that are induced by a separate mechanism. The micro-mechanical model predictions of Vs agree well with the results of this study and with the results of previous studies. They show that the mean effective stress and increase in inter-particle stiffness controls the low-strain stiffness despite a global increase in strains during monotonic loading."

Sweeping jets are self-oscillating devices that operate based on the Coanda effect, making them self-sustaining. In this study, the flow and heat transfer performance of an array of seven steady and sweeping impinging jets were investigated using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulent SST k-ω model. The sweeping jet impingement improved the heat removal performance by cooling a larger surface area of the leading edge with a constant heat flux and by improving the overall time-averaged cooling effectiveness. Compared with the steady jet case, the sweeping jet case shows an improvement in heat transfer of 12.2%. Further, the use of fluidic oscillators (sweeping jets) produced a more uniform mass flow rate distribution from all jets compared with a simple jet."

The current work focuses on the modification of the physical-based Voyiadjis Abed (VA) model by introducing an additional term, based on the concentration and diffusion kinetics of different impurities, to capture DSA in CP-Ti. The analysis of diffusion parameters indicates that the hydrogen impurity diffuse into the dislocation core and interact with the mobile dislocations, thus defining the temperature range for the activation of DSA at low and high strain rates. The results show that the modified VA model could capture DSA in CP-Ti over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures when the recommended novel modification based on physical and microstructural parameters was introduced."

The proposed method combines the global exploration capabilities of particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the local exploitation abilities of the quasi-Newton (QN) method to precisely estimate the motor and load inertias, shaft stiffness, and friction coefficients of the 2MM system. By integrating these two optimization techniques, the HPSO-QN method exhibits superior accuracy and performance compared to standard PSO algorithms. Experimental validation using a 2MM system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately identifying and improving the mechanical parameters of these complex systems. The HPSO-QN method offers significant implications for enhancing the modeling, performance, and stability of 2MM systems and can be extended to other systems with flexible shafts and couplings.

Length-to-diameter ratio (L<inf>t</inf>/D<inf>t</inf>), inlet pressure, and the cold mass fraction were investigated to achieve the highest energy separation of RHVT.

The optimal energy separation occurred at a 1.75° convergent angle, L<inf>t</inf>/D<inf>t</inf> ratio of 3, the inlet pressure of 600 kPa, and a cold mass fraction of 0.56. The internal flow structure of the vortex tube consists of a forced vortex, transition, and free vortex regions, as shown by the static temperature radial distribution This distribution provides an understanding of the energy separation mechanism of the vortex tube by correlating it with the density gradient along the radial direction.

The study objective is to mimic the cooling flow structure in gas turbine leading edge by using the rotating the semi-circular channel. These studies are conducted by considering a jet Reynolds number of 7500 at five different rotation speeds (ranging from 0 to 200 rpm). Numerical analysis is performed using the shear stress transport (SST) k−ω turbulence model with a properly analyzed fine mesh containing around eight million nodes. A test setup with required instrumentation is developed inhouse for this study. Two temperature measurement techniques, namely thermochromic liquid crystals (TLCs) and thermocouples, are adopted. Further, the target surface temperature contours are precisely analyzed by comparing the TLC temperature measurements with the numerical temperature results. The captured temperature contours indicated points of minimum-temperature regions, which corresponded to the jet impingement regions. By examining the temperature distribution along the axial centerline, a good agreement has been established between the numerical results and the experimental measurements. For a jet Reynolds number of 7500, increasing channel rotation speed from 0 to 250 rpm has reduced the variation in temperature between different jets. The size of inlet port used to guide flow to the feeding duct has a strong impact on jet formation and flow structure, and it has led to different mass flow rate across jets. Furthermore, a small deviation between numerical and experimental data can be observed near the end side of the channel owing to the radial and lateral heat transfer losses and outlet flow restriction."

The surface temperature distribution and pressure drop across the system were monitored under a range of designs and operating conditions including different flow rates, channel aspect ratios, jet spacings, and distribution of the flow rate between the jets and the channels. Our results show that increasing the number of jets minimizes the pressure drop, yet, results in higher surface temperatures. Increasing channel height decreased the pressure drop and enhanced the temperature uniformity. Using a double-layer heat sink instead of a single-layer one resulted in a decrease of 7.5% in surface temperature with a considerable reduction in pressure drop. Nevertheless, adding copper fins/posts in the lower channel layer is essential to help conduct the heat to the top layer and improve the heat removal rate. We also studied dividing the total flow rate between the jets and the main cooling channel and found that it can reduce the average temperature on the hot surface even though it did not improve the temperature uniformity. We verified our simulation results with experimental measurement for a single-layer hybrid heat sink with jet impingement and results matched with a temperature difference below 5 °C. Based on our simulations, the DL-hybrid module can remove high heat fluxes while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop."

This study utilizes MFNets to reduce data requirements and allow for an accurate representation of implicit functions through incorporating multi-fidelity data and exploiting the relationship between the data sources. The study also integrates the approximated implicit function with reliability optimization methods to allow large-scale composite systems to be decomposed and coordinates their solution strategies.

    "abstract": "Dynamic strain aging (DSA) is a sudden increase in the strength of a material under certain combinations of temperatures and strain rates. Despite the phenomenon being reported in several other studies, the literature still lacks a specific constitutive model that can physically interpret its effect. Therefore, this work proposes a modification based on physical parameters to the Voyiadjis and Abed (VA) model to account for the effect of DSA in C45 steel. The resulting modified model is then coupled with an energy-based damage model to further capture the effect of material softening. Previously, in VA model, it was assumed that the total activation energy for overcoming the obstacles without external work remains the same which works well in the absence of DSA. However, during DSA, the mobile dislocations are pinned by the diffusing solute atoms. This results in an increase in the total activation free energy needed by the dislocations to overcome the obstacle. Thus, an increase in strength is observed. It is shown in the current work that utilizing the concept of increased solute concentrations at local obstacles, in conjunction with the physical description that the VA model is based upon, successfully captures the phenomenon of DSA in C45 steel. In addition, the metal experiencing softening after reaching its ultimate strength is due to the significant growth of voids and cracks within the microstructure. To capture this behavior, an energy-based damage parameter is incorporated into the proposed model. The coupled plasticity-damage model shows a good comparison with the experimental results."

This study introduces novel physics-based approach that relies on the governing heat diffusion model linearity and superposition of point heat sources along crack to reduce thermal noise effect in crack length estimation. It utilises thermal images and their timestamps in sonic IR inspection to deliver spatiotemporal average representation of the aforementioned point heat sources to reduce thermal noise effect in crack length estimation. The proposed methodology is tested against two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element simulations with an arbitrary frictional heat generation function along crack. Virtual random thermal noise levels ranging between 50 and 200 mK, which are higher than IR cameras Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference values, are added to simulated results to reflect realistic and drastic thermal noise levels. Spatiotemporal averaging using combined sets of different thermal images captured at various times in single sonic IR inspection delivered about 16% total uncertainty in the estimation of a crack length at 95% confidence level based on 60 experiments. Similar uncertainty level is obtained using independently reported sonic IR experimental data."

This compliance can affect the accuracy of transient microfluidic experiments. We modeled the main effects of the compliance numerically to obtain the compliance as a function of microchannel dimensions without any fitting parameters as opposed to the ones available in the literature. We also modeled PDMS as a hyperelastic material to include its non-linear stress-strain relation. The model is based on the infinite thickness assumption and was determined to be valid when the PDMS thickness from all sides was higher than 3mm. The relationship obtained for the compliance provides a good fit for data outside of the study range with an error mostly within 4% based on the additional cases we simulated. The compliance was found to be non-linearly dependent on the cross-section with a slightly higher dependence on the height than the width. It also showed a linear dependence on the channel length."

Specifically, the presented NLFEA methodology, using 3D solid brick elements, is shown to overcome traditional prohibitive numerical burdens. This is demonstrated without compromising accuracy or upscaling applicability and appropriateness. The proposed NLFEA approach is highlighted through detailed modeling of RC bridges’ non-traditional structural components and loading aspects (elastomeric bearings and post-tension prestressing cables). The mechanical behavior of elastomeric isolators and the RC continua, including cracking and other nonlinear phenomena, are captured via 3D solid brick elements. Moreover, the modeling procedure accurately represents the post-tension tendons’ prestressing forces and the associated effects on the RC elements. The prestressing forces are incorporated within the tendon elements via insightful manipulations of stepwise initial conditions and internal force adjustments. Additionally, load-carrying capacity determination for the elastomeric bearings was achieved by conducting a parametric investigation to capture their mechanical behavior adequately. Eventually, the analysis of a full-scale bridge is presented in this paper. The post-tensioned RC bridge understudy spans 100 m over eight elastomeric (natural rubber) seismic isolator bearings. Twelve post-tension prestressing cables are utilized to provide the bridge with continuous internal tension-balancing forces. A high-fidelity detailed FEA model of the complete bridge is developed and validated against a SAP2000 FEA model. It is shown that reasonable computational efforts can be expected without compromising the accuracy of the results."

    "abstract": "Composite spherical shell panels are commonly used for the lightweight design of thin-walled structures in the structure, architecture, aerospace engineering. Depending on the shell panel length, thickness, curvature, and stacking sequence, the load-deflection response under lateral load can be either a completely stable equilibrium path or an unstable snap-through path. In this work, the response of simply supported cross-ply composite spherical shell panels subjected to lateral static loads is studied and optimized. The spherical shell exhibiting snap-through response is optimized to (a) maximize the load required to initiate snap-through and (b) minimize the unstable region. Meanwhile, the spherical shell exhibiting continuous response is optimized to (a) maximize the softening-hardening load and (b) minimize the shell weight. The decision variables for both constraint multi-objective optimization (CMOO) problems include layup sequence, thickness, and the radius of curvature to side length ratio. The nonlinear governing equations are derived based on Kirchhoff–Love hypotheses for thin shells and Hamilton's principle. A novel semi-analytical method is presented based on Bernstein polynomials combined with a fast iterative approach to compute the objective features of the responses. Benefiting from the high efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, the CMOO problems are solved by the metaheuristic Multi-Objective Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (MOAHA). Composite spherical shell panels with various geometry and lamination configurations are considered to validate the performance of the proposed method. The optimization of geometric parameters (shell curvature and thickness) in addition to the staking sequence provide a high degree of tailoring of the shell performance to meet various objectives. These parameters are taken as design variables that must be optimized to achieve some objectives and satisfy arbitrary nonlinear constraints."

The model captures the variation of lattice resistance (Critical Resolved Shear Stress; CRSS) in the crystal as the SRO changes depending on the probability of neighboring atoms. The methodology was applied to Ni-V binary alloys for a wide range of compositions and stacking fault widths. Dislocation core widths were determined as a function of SRO and energy parameters (unstable and intrinsic stacking fault energies; γ<inf>us</inf>, γ<inf>isf</inf>). The complex variation of CRSS with compositional variations shows good agreement with limited experimental results. The compositions corresponding to the transition from partial to full dislocations at higher vanadium contents are found depending on the SRO and the intrinsic energy levels."

The manufacturing parameters of ATP open mold processes, which comprise processing time, consolidation pressure and temperature, affect the bond strength between the plies and the quality of the laminates produced. Therefore, the effect of the manufacturing parameters should be characterized. This work experimentally evaluates the feasibility of fabricating thermoplastic laminates using an open mold process that reasonably models that of ATP. Glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene laminates are fabricated from unidirectional tapes under different consolidation periods, pressures, and temperatures. The bond quality in the produced laminates is assessed by measuring their interlaminar shear strength, which is measured using a short beam standardized shear test in conjunction with digital image correlation. Results show that consolidation can occur at temperatures slightly below the composite tapes’ complete melting temperature, and consolidation times between 7 and 13 min can result in acceptable bond strengths. The results confirmed the feasibility of the process and highlighted its limitations. Analysis of variance and machine learning showed that the effect of process parameters on interlaminar shear strength is nonlinear."

These variables are scrutinized through metrics such as elastic strain energy, the amount of work applied externally, and the movement of the panel. Utilizing finite element analysis, 27 distinct numerical experiments were conducted to gather data. The findings demonstrate that panels with a water-filled core exhibit superior blast resistance compared to their non-fluid counterparts. Specifically, panels with completely filled cores showed the lowest levels of panel displacement and external work, whereas those with half-filled cores recorded the highest elastic strain energy. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that plate thickness predominantly influences panel displacement and external work, whereas the fluid volume fraction within the core most significantly affects elastic strain energy.

In order to address these challenges, short polymer fibers are randomly dispersed in a cement-based matrix to form a highly ductile engineered cementitious composite (ECC). This material exhibits high ductility under tensile forces, with its tensile strain being several hundred times greater than conventional concrete. Since concrete is inherently weak in tension, the tensile strain capacity (TSC) has become one of the most extensively researched properties. As a result, developing a model to predict the TSC of the ECC and to optimize the mixture proportions becomes challenging. Meanwhile, the effort required for laboratory trial batches to determine the TSC is reduced. To achieve the research objectives, five distinct models, artificial neural network (ANN), nonlinear model (NLR), linear relationship model (LR), multi-logistic model (MLR), and M5P-tree model (M5P), are investigated and employed to predict the TSC of ECC mixtures containing fly ash.

The model’s effectiveness is evaluated and verified based on statistical parameters such as R<sup>2</sup>, mean absolute error (MAE), scatter index (SI), root mean squared error (RMSE), and objective function (OBJ) value.

To respond to these challenges, gas turbine manufacturers have turned to internal cooling and jet impingement to provide an effective solution for cooling the leading edge of the gas turbine blades. Fluidic oscillator is known for its sweeping behavior and expansive coverage of targeted surface and, thus, it can efficiently remove heat. In this study, the author numerically simulated the cooling performance of the leading edge of the gas turbine blades under constant heat flux while using four different configurations of jet impingement: a sweeping jet, a sweeping jet with chevrons, a steady jet, and a steady jet with chevrons. The results showed that the sweeping jet configuration with chevrons outperformed the steady jet configurations owing to oscillating jet impingement and a higher intensity of turbulence that increased the entrainment of jet flow. Under the configuration of a sweeping jet with chevrons, the targeted surface recorded an average Nusselt number that is 19.2% higher than the one with a steady jet without chevrons, along with a more uniform distribution of the surface temperature. The outstanding behavior of the sweeping jet with chevrons is due to the its internal flow behavior, i.e., oscillating flow nature of the sweeping jet with augmented turbulence at the exit of the chevron's nozzle."

The study then describes the development and implementation of new mathematical formulations for wet particle-particle interactions in a continuum model based on the classic kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). Quantitative validation, carried out by comparing the predicted and measured fluidization index (FI) expressed in terms of pressure drop, has shown a good match. The prediction also demonstrates increased bubble splitting, gas channeling, slugging fluidization, and energy dissipation induced by liquid bridges developing from wet particle interactions. These characteristics are similar to those commonly observed in the fluidization of cohesive powders. This model constitutes an important step in extending the continuum theories of dry flow to wet particle-particle interactions.

Two reliable metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model which are the coefficient of determination (Formula presented.) and mean squared error (MSE). The parameters that are affecting the compressive strength of UHPC are fly ash percentage levels (FA%), superplasticizer content, water to binder ratio (w/b), and curing period. A total of 54 ML models were used, consisting of Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, and Random forests algorithms. Among these models, Random Forest proved to be the most effective in capturing the relationships in UHPC’s behaviour with an R squared score of 0.8857. The Random Forest ML model is also used in this paper to conduct a parametric study that will help in obtaining the compressive strength of UHPC with higher content of FA%, which is not sufficiently studied in the literature."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate the potential functionalization of inherent nonlinearities associated with electrostatic MEMS resonators for low air pressure applications, with operating ranges as low as 0.65-295 mbar. The proposed pressure sensor is made of a polysilicon microplate subject to electrostatic actuation via an underneath electrode and attached to two cantilever microbeams. The pressure sensing mechanism relies on the motion-induced current method, a transduction mechanism that converts the dynamic alteration of the microplate due to pressure variations into an electrical signal detected via a lock-in amplifier. The experimental study showed evidence of the possible tunability of the pressure sensor via the deployment of different detection mechanisms to achieve superior performance in terms of sensitivity and low pressure operating range. These mechanisms rely on nonlinear dynamic features that result from the strong coupling between the microplate and the surrounding fluid along with the electrostatic actuation. These include dynamic pull-in instability, bifurcation and softening behavior associated with the elastic effect of the squeeze-film damping. The experimental results revealed that tracking the bifurcation frequency allows for the detection of low pressure levels, in the range of a few millibars. This capability is not provided by the resonance frequency shift method, which, while offering higher sensitivity, does not achieve the same low-pressure detection."

Therefore, this study computationally investigates the potential for improving the out-of-plane strength of honeycomb cores by superposing periodic sinusoidal perturbations to their cell walls. Such perturbations have been used to enhance the acoustic properties of honeycomb cores. Results demonstrated that introducing these perturbations can improve the strength of honeycomb cores under localized out-of-plane loadings resembling colliding with small objects at low impact speeds. Superposed perturbations increased the out-of-plane strength by a maximum of 28.5 % and eliminated the post-buckling softening behavior. Moreover, they increased the toughness, represented by the area under the force-displacement curve, under localized out-of-plane loads by a maximum of 56.7%.

    "abstract": "Flow of non-Newtonian fluids between parallel plates has many uses including heat transfer applications. Many non-Newtonian fluids can be categorized as pseudoplastic fluids. A broader category, power-law fluids, covers in addition dilatant and Newtonian fluids. Models for developing power-law fluid flow between parallel plates include computational and integral boundary layer methods. Most published studies include partial results and apply to one of the three categories. The present work addresses the three cases and exclusively shows the transition from developing to fully developed flow. In the inlet region, viscous effects are restricted to the boundary layer. The present approach is based on the inlet-filled region concept, and includes an additional zone, called filled region in which viscous effects are present in the whole region, with the flow asymptotically reaching the fully developed solution. The integral boundary layer method is used in both regions to solve for the flow. The results are found to be in good agreement with published Newtonian, pseudoplastic and dilatant fluid results for boundary layer thickness, centerline velocity, local friction factor, pressure drop profiles, and entrance region size. The present model is fundamentally analytical with minor computational work required."

    "abstract": "Under certain circumstances, flow in microchannels can exhibit compressibility effects even at Reynolds numbers (Re) around (below 2,300) and low Mach numbers (below 0.3). This is particularly true for gases, especially when the flow undergoes significant pressure changes or acceleration within the microchannel. This study investigates the compressibility effects encountered in two-parallel plates microchannels at these low Reynolds and Mach numbers, due to the high-pressure drop associated with the small scale of the microchannels. This uncommon flow is characterized by an exceptionally small channel diameter-to-length aspect ratio (∼10<sup>–3</sup>), resulting in a friction coefficient that deviates from the typical value for laminar flow between parallel plates (f = 96/Re). Both steady and transient effects on the flow field are examined under low Re subsonic flow, assuming continuum behavior. The ideal gas equation is used to model gas density, while the isothermal Tait-Murnaghan equation models liquid density. For gases, compressibility effects are observed primarily when the inlet pressure ratio exceeds 0.1. The results show that these effects are less pronounced for liquids, even at elevated inlet pressure ratios. Additionally, a flow delay across the channel exhibits a first-order transient response. For liquid flow, this effect depends on the channel resistance, the total fluid volume within the channel, and the liquid's bulk properties, rather than the inlet pressure ratio."

    "abstract": "Because of their improved properties, FRP composites are vastly used in the strengthening of aged concrete infrastructures. However, it has been observed that their performance is highly compromised when exposed to high temperatures, as expected during fire incidents, which critically affects FRP–concrete bond behavior, hence affecting the overall efficiency of the strengthening system. This paper critically presents the available literature concerning the degradation of bond strength between FRP systems with concrete substrates due to increased temperatures. Both analytical and numerical bond–slip models developed for the prediction of bond strength degradation under such conditions are reviewed. A generally confirmed fact is that exposure to high temperatures, especially those reaching glass transition temperature (T<inf>g</inf>) for epoxy adhesives, leads to bond degradation. Therefore, cement mortar-bonded CFRP textiles display better performance in fire endurance. This present paper also utilizes machine learning algorithms for the prediction of bond strength under elevated temperatures based on an experimental database of 37 beams. The nonlinear relationships and variable interactions in the developed model provide a reliable method for the estimation of bond strength with reduced extensive experimental testing, where the critical role of temperature in bond behavior is identified. This paper emphasizes the use of advanced predictive models to ensure the durability and safety of FRP-strengthened concrete structures in thermally challenging environments."

Differential-type inverters comprises three DC-DC converters that are linked in-parallel at the input side and differentially from the grid-side. These strutcures are commonly modulated using continuous modulation schemes (CMSs) for simpler operation and low-order harmonic suppression. In the CMS, the three DC-DC modules are activated for whole operating period, which increases the circulating power between the flyback modules and adversely affects the inverter efficiency. Therefore, this paper applies the discontinuous modulation scheme (DMS) scheme for single-stage three-phase DSFI and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the three-phase DSFI under CMS and DMS schemes. In addition, a simple single-pole selective harmonic compensation (SHC) loop is utilized for second-order harmonic compensation. The CMS reduces the low-order harmonic components in the grid currents; however, the voltage stress across the inverter different components is increased with increased circulating power. On the other hand, the proposed DMS reduces the voltage stress across the different components and reduces the circulating power between the inverter's modules, resulting in an enhanced system efficiency as a consequence. The proposed DSFI system is experimentally validated under CMS and DMS based on a 1.6 kW prototype in grid connected mode."

The flag is positioned at varying gap distances (G) from the bluff body. This distance varies from 0.5d to 9d, where d represents the diameter of the bluff body. A preliminary numerical analysis using the immersed boundary method reveals distinct wake patterns for each configuration. Subsequent wind tunnel experiments align with these findings, showing a range of instability regimes. For the “C-type” bluff body, flutter in flag occurs at gap distances between 3d and 9d, while no limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) are observed for closer distances (0.5d to 2d). In contrast, for the “IC-type” bluff body, the cut angle strongly influences the flag flutter dynamics, with the 60° cut cylinder exhibiting the most pronounced instability. As the cut angle increases, the instability regime narrows. The “U-type” bluff body results in asymmetric wake interaction, allowing the flag to flutter even in closer gap distances (G = 0.5d - 2d), with a subcritical bifurcation observed at G = 0.5d, which is not observed elsewhere. The onset of the flutter is notably advanced under the wake of “U-type” bluff body as compared to other bluff body shapes at higher gap distances (G = 3d to 9d). Overall, this study underscores the combined role of the bluff body shape and the gap distance on aeroelastic behavior of the flag, offering insights for designing efficient flutter-based energy harvesters at low Reynolds numbers."

Results show that increasing the amplitude and frequency of the perturbations generally decreases the flexural and transverse shear stiffness and yield strength. Local deformations in the perturbed cores indicate that imposing perturbations encouraged the development of localized deformations in the curved cell walls, which increased the perturbed cores' compliance. The transverse shear and flexural responses at the highest frequencies and amplitudes exhibited a very smooth and compliant behavior compared to the unperturbed cores. The response of the perturbed cores can be attractive for applications involving impact energy mitigation, as they demonstrate an enhanced capacity to reduce and limit the force transmitted through them."

The objective is to automatically identify key drilling phases from the vibrational signal, including material removal and drill retraction. After comparing various techniques for signal segmentation, the variability or spread of the data signal was the most significant feature in identifying the material removal period.

A major drawback that hinders the efficient use of test measurements is the limited description specified by the relevant standards regarding how the overall investigation program should be carried out. This study discusses two elements of the investigation program: homogeneity of different concrete zones and the locations for core extraction. Different homogeneity measures have been investigated to identify heterogeneous concrete zones using extensive statistical analysis of synthetic datasets. The considered homogeneity measures were: t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, earth mover's distance, and Cramér-von Mises distance. The results of the analysis indicated that the earth mover's distance and Cramér-von Mises distance outperform the traditional t-test in the identification of heterogenous concrete zones, and hence, recommended to be used for concrete assessment. Furthermore, different sampling plans of core locations, namely, similarity sampling, cluster sampling, proportional stratified sampling, and post-sampling are investigated through the generation of risk curves as indicators of the estimation quality of each sampling plan. It was found that a reduction in the probability of inaccurate concrete strength estimation is feasible. As such, the utilization of sampling plans in concrete assessment can enhance the reliability of the assessment."

The nonlinear metric e(t¯) is based on a novel implementation of the phase-space warping method and obtained from the orbits representing the floors' motions in pseudo phase-space. A scaled-down model of a four-floor moment-resisting frame building is designed and fabricated to demonstrate and to compare the capabilities of the three damage indices. Structural damage is introduced to individual columns, to mimic damage initiation, by cutting two notches on opposite sides of a column cross-section at midheight. The ADIn(t¯) detected large damage events, fast deterioration beyond them, and the onset of failure using any of the four floor accelerations. The FDIn(t¯) proved insensitive to damage compared with the other two metrics. The nonlinear metric e(t¯) detected gradual (fatigue-induced) deterioration in the building's health before introduction of damage, large damage events, fast deterioration beyond them, and the onset of failure, using any of the four floor accelerations. The e(t¯) metric varied slowly and continuously with gradual deterioration and exhibited larger discontinuous jumps with discrete damage events.

The required data processing is typically easily manageable compared to the deployment efforts. Consequently, moving sensors are becoming more desirable and feasible as more sophisticated algorithms mature. Sensors (accelerometers) mounted on moving vehicles detect a combination of vibration responses as they drive by bridges. The resulting vehicle vibrations are produced by several interacting excitations, such as bridge vibration, road surface roughness, and vehicle-induced vibrations. So, the measured accelerations are contaminated by these sources and cannot be assumed to be inherent to the bridge. As such, a proper understanding of the dynamic vehicle-bridge interaction phenomenon is essential. Several algorithms and processes must be implemented to obtain a denoised bridge signature signal suitable for modal identification purposes. An integrated algorithm for performing vehicle response deconvolution is introduced. This novel algorithm combines the previously published algorithms for vehicle response deconvolution, the frequency response function (FRF), and the ensemble empirical modal decomposition (EEMD).

This Hybrid Digital/Analog Predistorter (H-DAPD) uses a low order memory polynomial as a baseband digital predistortion function. To alleviate the complexity of the analog predistorter implementation, an amplitude only predistortion function is adopted. The analog predistortion function is used to perform a coarse linearization of the amplifier. The digital predistortion function is then applied to linearize the system made of the analog predistorter and the power amplifier. The H-DAPD predistortion system is found to be superior to purely analog and to purely digital predistortion systems by combining key advantages present in each of these systems. The robustness of the proposed H-DAPD with respect to the hardware impairments that are typically associated with the implementation of analog predistortion is thoroughly discussed, and shown to be superior to that of conventional hybrid and analog predistortion systems. Experimental validation performed on a commercial power amplifier prototype using 5G new radio (NR) test signals demonstrates the enhanced robustness of the proposed H-DAPD to hardware impairments. It was found that standard compliant adjacent channel leakage ratio is obtained with up to 0.3dB resolution in the analog predistorter's AM/AM function, and up to 3ns delay misalignment between the input and control signals of the analog predistorter. The proposed system is expected to pave the road for future hybrid predistortion systems."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Monitoring attributes is crucial in industrial settings where quality features are not directly measurable. This study introduces a modified Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) scheme, named wCUSUM, to enhance the efficiency of monitoring attribute characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The wCUSUM scheme improves detection capability by elevating the difference between the actual and in-control numbers of nonconforming items to an exponent w. The charting parameters of the wCUSUM scheme are optimized to minimize the Average Number of Defectives (AND) across out-of-control scenarios while satisfying the constraint of the in-control Average Time to Signal (ATS<inf>0</inf>). A comparative analysis evaluates the wCUSUM scheme’s performance against the semi-optimal wCUSUM chart proposed by Wu et al. (2008). Sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the impact of design parameters and inertia on the performance of the wCUSUM chart. A solar panel manufacturing case study demonstrates the proposed chart’s superiority. Findings: The optimal wCUSUM outperforms the semi-optimal wCUSUM1 (w = 1) by 13.21%, wCUSUM1.5 (w = 1.5) by 10.58% and wCUSUM2 (w = 2) by 20.93% in terms of AND under different settings. The wCUSUM enhances detection speed by 19% and 51%, assuming uniform and Rayleigh distributions of the shift, respectively, in comparison to its traditional counterpart. In addition, the wCUSUM outperforms the traditional scheme by 21% in terms of the Expected value of the out-of-control Average Number of Observations to Signal (EANOS). The case study shows a 65% detection efficacy improvement over the semi-optimal wCUSUM. Research limitations/implications: The proposed wCUSUM chart offers practitioners a robust, economic and efficient tool for monitoring attribute processes. Although its current design aims to monitor a single attribute characteristic, future work could explore its application in multi-attribute scenarios. Originality/value: This study introduces a novel wCUSUM scheme, tailoring the exponent w to achieve optimal performance. This approach supports customized control chart designs, enhancing adaptability to diverse process monitoring needs."

No negative effect associated with the increase in FA replacement percentage up to 60% by weight is observed in terms of compressive strength of UHPC without superplasticizer. However, higher replacement percentages are shown to negatively affect the compressive strength. Further investigations should focus on the compressive strength characteristics and limitations associated with elevated levels of FA replacement, i.e. 60–80%. A promising behaviour associated with higher replacement percentages is observed in few studies. Moreover, the superior compressive strengths observed up to 50% FA replacement after a curing period of 90 days underscore the need for a more extensive exploration of longer curing durations.

Various mechanical and chemical treatments have historically been used to stabilize the swelling behavior of clay soils. This work investigates the potential use of shredded plastic waste to reduce the swelling pressure and compressibility of clay soils. Two types of highly plastic clay (CH) soils were selected. Three different dimensions of plastic waste pieces were used, namely lengths of 0.5 cm, 1.0 cm, and 1.5 cm, with a width of 1 mm. A blend of plastic–cement waste with a ratio of 1:5 by weight was prepared. Different fractions of the plastic–cement waste blend with a 2 wt.% increment were added to the clay soil, which was then remolded in a consolidometer ring at 95% relative compaction and 3.0% below the optimum. The zero swell test, as per ASTM D4546, was conducted on the remolded soil samples after three curing periods: 1, 2, and 7 days. This method ensures the accurate evaluation of swell potential and stabilization efficiency over time. The experimental results showed that the addition of 6.0–8.0% of the blend significantly reduced the swelling pressure, demonstrating the mixture’s effectiveness in soil stabilization. It also reduced the swell potential of the expansive clay soil and had a substantial effect on the reduction in its compressibility, especially with a higher aspect ratio. The compression index decreased, while the maximum past pressure increased with a higher plastic–cement ratio. The 7-day curing time is the optimum time to stabilize expansive clay soils with the plastic–cement waste mixture. This study provides strong evidence that plastic waste can enhance soil mechanical properties, making it a viable geotechnical solution."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Concrete is widely used in coastal construction, tetrapod armour units as the top layer of breakwaters, which protect rear-side developments by dissipating wave energy. However, concrete poses environmental impacts across its life cycle. There is a remarkable gap in the literature on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of concrete armour units, despite their widespread usage in coastal engineering. To address this, this study evaluates the environmental impact of tetrapod armour over its life cycle. Methods: An LCA is undertaken using SimaPro software, applying a cradle-to-gate approach that focuses on production, transportation, and placement stages of tetrapods, concrete and steel for casting. The functional unit (FU) is “5-meter of breakwater.” Due to limited data in the literature, the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is mainly obtained from the ecoinvent database available on SimaPro. Energy data for the unit processes is gathered from literature and manufacturers. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is undertaken using a mid-point approach in the CML-IA method. Additionally, the non-renewable fossil impact category under the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) method is evaluated, since non-renewable resources are major contributors in tetrapod production. Results: The CML-IA results show that cast production emerged as the predominant contributor, comprising over 80% of the total impacts across all categories. Notably, cast production has the highest influence on non-renewable fossil impacts under CED, with a value of 2.62E+06 MJ per FU. This highlights the significant energy burden of steel in tetrapods and underscores the importance of decision-making during the production stage. Additionally, sensitivity analysis revealed that the system has low sensitivity to changes in transportation distance. Discussion: The study confirms cast production dominates the total environmental impacts and fossil energy use. Further research is needed to analyze large quarry rocks use for the armour layers, while accounting for regional variables to obtain more reliable results. The findings emphasize the need to explore alternative materials and production methods to reduce the environmental footprint of tetrapods while maintaining their protective effectiveness in coastal construction."

While fly ash has been widely studied as a supplementary material in ECC, research on Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) as a sustainable cement alternative is still limited. This study addresses this gap by investigating the mechanical performance of polyethylene fiber-reinforced ECC (PE-ECC) with GGBS replacement levels of 30%, 60%, and 90%. Additionally, dune sand is explored as a substitute for silica sand, a relatively under-researched aspect in ECC development. Standardized compressive and tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of GGBS and dune sand on strength and ductility. The 60% GGBS mix demonstrated the highest compressive strength (72.5 MPa) and tensile strain capacity (3.066%), while the 30% GGBS mix exhibited the highest tensile strength (7.77 MPa). The 90% GGBS mix showed the lowest permeability (780 coulombs) in the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT), indicating superior durability in aggressive environments. These findings highlight the potential of GGBS and dune sand as effective substitutes in ECC, contributing to more sustainable and durable construction materials."

In addition, the GGBFS-based sample have shown an increased durability as it passed less chloride ions when compared to conventional concrete. A total of four beams were cast using the proposed mix and then tested under three-point loading and four-point loading. The beams were categorized into group 1, samples designed to fail in flexure, and group 2, samples designed to fail in shear. The performances of the GGBFS-based specimens were evaluated and compared to the control beams. In flexure, the GGBFS-based sample carried 83% of the control sample’s ultimate load which is considerably less than the expected 96%. Whereas the GGBFS-based shear deficient sample carried 79% of the load carried by the control beam. Although GGBFS samples carried less load, it is concluded that use of GGBFS as a full replacement to OPC is practical as the normalized capacity of GGBFS samples is comparable to that of the control samples. Additionally, using GGBFS contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions and hence promotes the use of sustainable and green concrete."

Meanwhile, the depletion of normal concrete materials, which are essential for construction, requires urgent solutions. Researchers have attempted to obtain suitable sustainable materials to replace traditional concrete materials. Seashells are one such material, as they can be used as cement at different replacement levels during sustainable concrete production. Consequently, reduced cement production can lower environmental pollution and save natural resources from depletion. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different types of seashells as partial replacements of cement on concrete properties. Then, the physical properties, chemical composition and mechanical and durability properties of seashell-based concrete are determined. The results obtained by previous studies indicate that adding seashells to concrete mixtures can decrease the compressive strength of concrete, especially at the early curing age. High-particle size seashells reduce the flexural and tensile strengths of cement, whereas fine-particle size seashells increase flexural and tensile strengths owing to the good bonding between aggregates and the binder matrix. The porosity and absorption of concrete at low-replacement levels are lower than those of the control concrete sample. The workability of concrete decreases with increasing seashell content. Therefore, seashells can potentially be used as renewable and sustainable concrete materials, especially for materials with low replacement levels. This study recommends adopting new treatment methods of using seashells in high amounts to replace cement materials, thereby contributing to the reduced release of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions."

The results show that the proper use of solid waste to replace part of the binder or aggregate has a positive effect on the performance development of UHPC, but further enhancement techniques should be developed. When solid waste is prepared as a binder, the durability of waste based UHPC can be effectively improved by grinding and activation. When solid waste is used as an aggregate, its rough surface, potential reactivity and internal curing effect are also beneficial to the improvement of UHPC performance. Since UHPC has a dense microstructure, it can effectively prevent the leaching of harmful elements (heavy metal ions) in solid waste. However, the effect of waste modification on the reaction products of UHPC needs to be further studied, and design methods and testing standards suitable for eco-friendly UHPCs should be developed.

The mechanical (tension, compression, flexure) and corresponding self-sensing properties under monotonic and cyclic loading, self-healing, thermal conductivity, and thermal effusivity properties were examined.

The electromechanical behaviour was consistent and repeatable during cyclic and monotonic loading processes, and a microstructure model was used to explain the self-sensing mechanism.

    "abstract": "The disposal of hazardous waste materials in landfills and open areas creates a severe impact on the environment. Silica Fume (SF), a by-product from the ferrosilicon and silicon industry, is generated in high quantities. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of reusing SF to produce high-strength concrete (HSC) and ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) instead of discarding it. This paper herein reviews the current research on SF in concrete and discusses the physical and chemical properties, mechanical properties, durability, and microstructure. Depending on the concentration of the SF, flexural, tensile, and compressive strength was positively influenced. Also, SF improved the pore size to increase drying shrinkage through the pozzolanic reaction. A few studies showed the disadvantages of SF exhibiting the negative impact on workability and shrinkage of concrete. The influence of SF on cement hydration products should be analyzed from the microstructure perspective."

    "abstract": "Statistical Process Control (SPC) is employed to support the effective quality performance of production and manufacturing processes. The control chart is a type of SPC utilized to reduce variability in key quality parameters, leading to the production of quality conforming products. Control charts, such as the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) are widely used to reduce variation, improve productivity, and ensure quality. However, small manufacturers face challenges that may prevent their effective use of quality control charts. One such challenge relates to resource constraints. These constraints tend to inhibit the conduct of quality inspections at high rates. With this in mind, the present study sets out to develop and present an improved EWMA control chart for effective quality control that takes into consideration significant resource constraints in a small aluminium manufacturing firm. The findings suggest that adopting the improved EWMA chart can enhance the detection of any increase in defectives without the need for additional resources. The improved EWMA control chart provides small manufacturers with an enhanced quality conforming tool developed based on practical realities. Implications for both practice and theory are also highlighted."

High levels of solid waste produced by raw materials release dangerous gases like nitrous and Sulphur oxides, which are very harmful to the environment. In recent years, the usage of fibers has tremendously increased to make significantly robust structures. For sustainable, waste-free development, manufactured fibers can be replaced with natural fibers without compromising on the requirements. This study considers various natural fibers like basalt, coconut/coir, banana, sugarcane bagasse, hemp, kenaf, bamboo, jute, sisal, abaca, and cotton, and their effects on fresh and hardened concrete have been discussed. This article also reviews the composition, preparation, and processing procedures of various natural fibers, and their potential applications in building materials are highlighted. Future research avenues are identified, and possible negative impacts and limitations are discussed. Our findings confirm the feasibility of standard concrete using natural fibers in cement or geopolymer concrete.

    "title": "Influence of palm oil fuel ash on the high strength and ultra-high performance concrete: A comprehensive review — Farid Abed",
    "abstract": "In recent days, the increase in significant infrastructure projects has led to urgent requirements for the use of high strength concrete (HSC) and ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). However, the use of cement and its derivative products, such as concrete, is associated with a high generation of carbon dioxide (CO2). The construction industry contributes about 8% of the total global CO2 production. Therefore, there is an urgent need to use agriculture-waste materials such as palm oil fuel ash (POFA) to help reduce environmental concerns associated with concrete. The accumulation of palm oil waste over an extended period of time causes environmental pollution. The use of these materials is expected to improve the environment by reducing the disposal of this waste in landfills and open areas. The chemical composition of POFA can vary depending on the source and processing methods. Elevated levels of impurities such as organic matter, unburned carbon, and chloride content in POFA can adversely affect the setting time, workability, and long-term durability of concrete. The optimal mix proportioning and replacement levels of POFA in concrete need to be carefully determined. Incorporating higher levels of POFA without proper adjustments to the mix design can result in detrimental effects on fresh and hardened concrete properties, including reduced compressive strength and decreased resistance to chemical attacks. This paper will highlight the impacts of POFA on the properties of HSC and UHPC in their fresh and hardened states. Durability and microstructure properties were also discussed. The use of ultrafine POFA helped in reducing the rapid chloride permeability and water absorption of HSC, thus improved its structure. Lastly, some recommendations for future studies are presented."

    "abstract": "In this study, the feasibility of utilizing locally produced coarse recycled aggregate (RA) from demolition waste in the UAE for structural applications was investigated. A comprehensive literature review on the subject showed that the shear and flexural responses of reinforced beams utilizing aggregate from concrete demolition waste are greatly dependent on the aggregate replacement ratio and the quality of the recycled aggregate. The experimental program in this study consisted of three phases. Phase I focused on the evaluation of the physical and mechanical characteristics of the RA, Phase II addressed the mix design and fresh and hard properties of the concrete, and Phase III dealt with the flexural and shear behavior of structural members. The research involved twelve 150 mm × 300 mm reinforced concrete beams with a length of 1500 mm or 2000 mm that were made with 0% (control), 50%, or 100% recycled coarse aggregate, replacing natural coarse aggregate (NA). Two target concrete compressive strengths, 25 and 35 MPa, were considered in the investigation. The results showed that the recycled aggregates had lower crushing and LA abrasion values by 40% and 18–28%, respectively, whereas the absorption capacity was 40–300% higher compared to the natural aggregate. In addition, the mechanical properties of the concrete made with different replacement ratios (R%) of RA were either similar or slightly less than those of the control mix. The shear beam tests with (Formula presented.) = 25 MPa showed that the 50%- and 100%-replacement-ratio beams demonstrated closely matched normalized shear strength values that exceeded their corresponding NA beam by 12.5%, while the shear beam tests with (Formula presented.) = 35 MPa showed that the NA beam exhibited normalized shear strength surpassing the 50% RA and 100% RA beams by 12.5% and 17.5%, respectively. In the flexural beam tests, the flexural strength exhibited minimal disparities for the beams that shared the same RA% but differed in their compressive strength targets, and overall, the variation in the RA% had a marginal impact on the flexural strength of the beams. Further, an increase in the RA% corresponded to an increase in the shear ductility index, which was in contrast with the findings on the flexural ductility index. Furthermore, predictions of flexural strength using the ACI318-19 code and shear strength using the strut-and-tie model yielded comparable results to the experimental ones."

    "abstract": "This study considers 12 pervious concrete mixes incorporating 100% recycled coarse aggregate from old concrete demolition waste and containing various amounts of natural fine aggregate and date palm leaves fibers. First, the properties of the recycled aggregate in terms of their particle size distribution, abrasion resistance, crushing values, specific gravity and water absorption are obtained. Next, the pervious concrete density, compressive strength, tensile strength, permeability and porosity are determined by experimental testing following the relevant standards. The results are analyzed and compared to determine the influence of using recycled coarse aggregate in the mixtures and the impact of the amount of natural sand and volume fraction of the fibers on the mechanical properties, permeability and porosity of the concrete. Findings of the study showed that the use of recycled coarse aggregate in pervious concrete without fine aggregate reduced the compressive strength by 36% and tensile strength by 57%. Replacing 11.7% of the recycled coarse aggregate with natural sand and adding date palm leaves fibers in an amount equivalent to 0.64% volumetric content to such concrete helped increase the compressive strength by 16.2% and tensile strength by 3.2% above the corresponding strengths of the control mix. There is a clear relationship between permeability and porosity due to their correlation with the density of pervious concrete, and the effect of porosity on tensile strength is more influential than it is on the compressive strength. An equation that can predict the tensile strength of pervious concrete from the compressive strength is proposed, as a function of the natural fine aggregate fraction of the coarse aggregate and volumetric content of natural fibers. Results of the research confirm the feasibility of using recycled aggregate in pervious concrete mixes and the positive impact of natural fibers on the mechanical properties."

Nonetheless, the energy efficiency of DWC systems is affected by the inherent misalignments of the mobile EVs, causing fluctuations in the amount of energy transmitted to the EVs. In this work, a multi-coil secondary-side inductive link (IL) design is proposed with independent double-D (DD) and quadrature coils to reduce the effect of coupling fluctuations on the power received during misalignments. Dual-sided inductor–capacitor–capacitor (LCC) compensation networks are utilized with power and current control circuits to provide a load-independent, constant current output at different misalignment conditions. The LCC compensation components are tuned to maximize the power transferred at the minimum acceptable coupling point, (Formula presented.). This compensates for the leaked energy during misalignments and minimizes variations in the operating frequency during zero-phase angle (ZPA) operation. Simulations reveal an almost constant output power for different lateral misalignment (LTMA) values up to (Formula presented.) mm for a 25 kW system, with a power transfer efficiency of (Formula presented.).

Therefore, the need for stabilizing the soil against erosion is a major goal of geotechnical engineer. This research presents a comprehensive experimental testing program of using cement-glass mixture to stabilize clayey soils against internal erosion. Two types of clayey soils (CH and ML) were mixed with different percentages of cement-crushed glass mixtures by dry weight of the soil and tested at different curing times. Hole Erosion Test (HET) was employed to evaluate the internal erosion parameters mainly the erosion rate index and the critical shear. The results showed that the addition of 5% and 8% of cement-crushed glass by dry weight of clay resulted in a significant reduction in the internal erosion and substantial increase in the critical shear stress for ML and CH soils, respectively.

Improving thermoplastic FRP's performance and sustainability is instrumentally dependent on optimizing their fabrication process parameters to minimize the energy consumed in their manufacturing without compromising their structural properties. Accordingly, this work utilizes experiments and artificial intelligence to model the relationship between interlaminar shear strength and the critical processing parameters in thermoplastic FRP laminate fabrication. These parameters are processing time, temperature, and pressure. Moreover, this work aims to utilize artificial intelligence to design the most sustainable processing sequence that reduces energy consumption without affecting FRP's structural integrity, represented by interlaminar shear strength.

Results demonstrated that increasing the processing time, pressure, and temperature beyond a certain threshold can deteriorate the fabricated laminates' performance.

The mechanical properties, self-healing behavior, and multi-scale microstructure of CSA-ECC at different curing ages were analyzed through compression, tensile, flexural, and wet-dry cycling experiments, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using two different CR particle sizes and replacement rates. The feasibility of this material for ultra-thin white-topping applications was investigated. The results indicate that the addition of CR significantly improved the bending deformation capacity of CSA-ECC. At 3 days, the deflection increased by 1.24–1.43 times compared to the reference mixture (M0), which exhibited a deflection of 5.91 mm. Although the incorporation of CR reduced compressive and flexural strengths, the minimum values at 3 days still exceeded the requirements for airport pavements, reaching 32 MPa and 6.43 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of CR reduced crack widths and improved strain capacity by 80 %. These improvements contribute to the high ductility and crack resistance required for seamless pavement applications. In addition, after 15 wet-dry cycles, small cracks in the CR-containing CSA-ECC mixtures were almost completely sealed, with the healing products primarily consisting of dense crystals of C-S-H and CaCO₃. These findings suggest that CSA-ECC with CR is highly suitable for ultra-thin white-topping applications in airport pavements, and the study holds significant implications for promoting sustainable airport pavement construction and the development of CSA-ECC materials."

    "abstract": "The FeMnAlNi Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) holds significant potential for many applications as it exhibits superelastic (SE) properties across a wide temperature range with high transformation stresses. This Fe-based system offers an economical alternative for costly SMA such as NiTi while offering superior damping characteristics. However, only a limited number of compositions based on the FeMnAlNi system have been considered in the literature. This study explores the enhancement of superelastic properties in FeMnAlNi through alloying with vanadium. Two compositions, Fe<inf>42</inf>Mn<inf>34</inf>Al<inf>15</inf>Ni<inf>7.5</inf>V<inf>1.5</inf> and Fe<inf>42</inf>Mn<inf>34</inf>Al<inf>12.5</inf>Ni<inf>7.5</inf>V<inf>5</inf> (at.%), were prepared and various cyclic heat treatment and aging processes were considered aiming to increase the transformation stress levels. Vanadium addition stabilized the BCC austenitic phase, suppressed the γ-phase precipitation, and promoted the development of a coarse-grained structure that is conducive to superelasticity. At 5-at.% V, a stable BCC phase with large grains was obtained, but no significant reversible transformation was observed at all the considered heat treatments. However, at 1.5-at.% V, SE was achieved, with transformation stress varying by aging conditions. The highest transformation stress of approximately 1,090 MPa, a record for FeMnAlNi-based SMAs, was obtained under optimized aging conditions. These findings highlight the role of vanadium in tailoring superelastic properties in FeMnAlNi SMAs."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the vibration suppression of cantilevered beams using nonlinear shunted piezoelectric circuits. The beam’s inertia and geometric nonlinearities are considered. A quadratic nonlinear piezoelectric capacitance is used such that there exists a two-to-one internal resonance between the mechanical and electrical modes. The internal resonance coupling is exploited to trigger the saturation phenomenon such that the beam’s vibration reaches a limit beyond an excitation amplitude threshold. The equations governing the nonlinear vibration of the beam coupled with the shunt circuit are derived, and modal analysis is used to obtain a system of two nonlinearly coupled modal equations. The equations are then numerically integrated to obtain the results. A parametric study is performed to assess the significance of system parameters, such as the location of the piezoelectric patch, its size, circuit resistance, and nonlinear gain, on the effectiveness of vibration suppression. The results show that the proposed design effectively suppresses the linear and nonlinear vibrations of the beam. The proposed absorber is space-efficient and does not add mass to the primary system, and hence, it has the potential in systems where the weight matters, such as aerospace applications."

The simulation results reveal that a system with a non-symmetric beam design is adequate for broadband energy harvesting.

Reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams strengthened and pre-stressed with Fe-SMA bars are numerically investigated for their flexural response under the influence of various parameters. The bars are embedded in a concrete layer attached to the beam’s soffit. Based on the numerical results, it was found that increasing the compression strength from 30 to 60 MPa slightly improves the beam’s strength (by 2%), but it significantly increases its ductility by approximately 45%. As opposed to this, the strength and ductility of the pre-stressed T-beam are considerably improved by using a larger diameter of Fe-SMA bars. Specifically, using 12 mm Fe-SMA bar over 6 mm resulted in 65% and 47% greater strength and ductility, respectively. Furthermore, this study examines the importance of considering the flange in the flexural design of pre-stressed beams.

In this regard, high and medium entropy alloy systems exhibit great potential in cost-to-performance trade-off as bifunctional electrodes. In particular, the richness in mixing various elements with different hydrogen bonding abilities brings the possibility to tune the catalytic properties that aim for high HER/OER efficiency. In this regard, CoNiCr and CoNiV systems are highly promising model systems with only 3 elements and low hydrogen diffusivity. Also, excellent corrosion resistance in acidic/alkaline environments and high conductivity, and simple crystal structure make these materials very auspicious candidates for HER/OER studies. Here, we have evaluated the electrocatalytic performance of the medium entropy alloy system NiCo(Cr/V) for water splitting. For our investigations, thin films of three compositions namely, NiCoCr, NiCoV, and NiCo(Cr/V) were fabricated using magnetron sputtering. In particular, the NiCo(CrV) (thickness: 1 μm) demonstrates excellent performance with overpotentials of 87 and 320 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and Tafel slopes of 96 and 69 mV/dec towards HER and OER, respectively in 1 M KOH solution. Our findings suggest that the higher HER catalytic activity originates from the synergistic effects of the multicomponent alloy system in single-phase, while the higher OER activity comes from the multicomponent functional oxides of NiCo(CrV) generated on the surface during CV activation. An alkaline electrolysis cell with NiCo(CrV) as bifunctional electrode requires only 1.58 V to maintain 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, with outstanding electrochemical stability with no compositional reorganization after long-term durability tests."

The observations of non-unique ORs are explained using the energy-minimization theory of martensite revealing dependence of OR on the internal morphology of the martensitic phase, whether twinned or stacking-faulted. It is shown that the twin-variants of an internally twinned martensitic structure individually explain the Pitsch and K-S ORs. The N-W OR was observed in a stacking-faulted substructure of martensite. Through a novel extension to the energy-minimization theory for stacking-faulted substructures, the N-W OR is explained. Thus, the current study challenges the notion of OR as a material-characteristic and reveals a dependence of the OR on the internal substructure of the martensitic phase in SMAs, further establishing the OR for the new SMA FeMnNiAl."

The framework utilizes the double-walled hexagonal lattice which exhibits limited and narrow band gaps. The band gap characteristics of the double-walled hexagonal lattice are enhanced by increasing their number and width by imposing sinusoidal periodic perturbations on the lattice's cell walls. The imposed perturbations are controlled through their frequency and amplitude. A wide range of frequencies and amplitudes are considered to realize perturbed lattices with band gaps that cover the entire frequency range between 0 and 1000 kHz. The band gaps of each perturbed lattice over a range of porosities are obtained using finite element analysis. Machine learning, namely parallel multilayer neural networks, is used to model the relationship between porosity, perturbation amplitude and frequency on one side and band gap characteristics on the other. Results show that the proposed neural networks can predict the band gap characteristics with an average accuracy that exceeds 80%. The proposed neural networks are used to invert the topology-band gap relationship and determine the lattice parameters needed to provide a prescribed band gap characteristic. Based on the achieved accuracy of the proposed neural networks, the neural networks are used in the design framework to identify a few candidate solutions which are subsequently filtered using finite element analysis. The proposed framework promises to significantly minimize the time-consuming iterations associated with designing lattices with prescribed band gap behavior. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to design a lattice material with a band gap between 575 and 625 kHz."

Superelasticity was observed for samples rolled to reduction levels exceeding 90 %. However, the recovery magnitudes improved significantly following 96.6 % rolling due to the optimization of the grain size. The reduction in grain size, from about 400 μm in the homogenized conditions to 50 μm for the 96.6 % rolled state, increases slip resistance which consequently promotes superelasticity. The functional superelastic properties were also evaluated for samples with geometric stress concentration (drilled hole).

    "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have attracted significant attention due to their low operating temperature, high efficiency, and minimal emissions. Especially when hydrogen is used as fuel, water is the only product. Among the various components of PEM fuel cells, the membrane is crucial one because it enables the transfer of protons from the anode to the cathode, while ensuring that the fuel and oxidant remain separate and do not mix. Hightemperature operation (above the boiling point of water) is desired in PEM fuel cells as it enhances the kinetics and improves water management. However, the current most widely used membrane, Nafion, cannot operate at high temperatures above 90°C due to the membrane's dehydration, resulting in decreased proton conductivity and eventually, fuel cell efficiency. To overcome this issue, this study focuses on the development of new and potentially high-temperature composite membranes. Zirconium silicate, (ZrSiO4)/Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite membranes were synthesized in this work with the following ratios: 0 wt.%, 1.5 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 8 wt.% per mass of membrane solution via a solution casting method.

    "title": "ENHANCING IMPACT RESISTANCE AND VIBRATION PERFORMANCE OF COMPOSITE SANDWICH PANELS USING SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS: A LITERATURE REVIEW AND IDENTIFICATION OF RESEARCH GAPS — Zied Bahroun, Noha M. Hassan",
    "abstract": "Composite sandwich panels are widely used in aeros pace and civil applications due to their lightweight nature, strength, stiffness, corrosion resistance, and sound insulation properties. However, these panels often lack sufficient resistance to impact damage, resulting in reduced mechanical performance. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have shown potential in improving the impact resistance of composite sandwich panels. SMAs can dissipate energy through phase transformations, leading to hysteresis loops in stress -strain diagrams during structural vibrations and impact loading. This paper presents a literature review of the use of SMAs in composite sandwich panels, focusing on their impact resistance and vibration performance. Various studies on incorporating SMA in composite panels have been analyzed, considering factors such as natural vibration, buckling behavior, impact resistance, energy absorption, and fracture behavior. The findings demonstrate that SMA can enhance the performance of composite sandwich panels, leading to improved impact resistance, reduced d eflection, increased contact forces, and enhanced energy absorption. However, the optimal configuration and parameters of SMA reinforcement in composite panels require further investigation. The review highlights current research trends and identifies gaps that can be addressed for further improvement in composite sandwich panels' performance."

This alloy system shows shape memory and superelastic properties across a large temperature range. However, many studies have pointed out the need for rather complex thermo-mechanical treatments for the optimization of the SMA properties. In addition, works considering the effects of alloying on the development of microstructures that are more conducive to pseudo-elasticity in this system remain limited. Hence, systematic studies aiming at the investigation of the microstructural evolution of the FeMnNiAl(Gd) system are of great interest. In this study, solution heat treatment is done to tune the microstructure for optimum mechanical properties. The effect of phase distribution on mechanical properties is investigated at different heat treatments. Whereas cyclic heat treatment induced abnormal grain growth (AGG) in all samples, so large grains were obtained. The phase variation and elemental composition are analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, respectively. The microstructure and phase distribution are observed using Scanning Electron Microscope and then related to the microhardness results. The microstructure has a good correlation with mechanical properties where the fine distribution of phases results in a higher hardness number."

The nano-size NbC electrodes were fabricated and supported on carbon cloth (CC). The NbC@CC materials were assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor with a 1 M sulfuric acid (H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>) as an electrolyte. The properties of the symmetric supercapacitor were evaluated for their electrochemical behavior, surface properties and morphology. The results showed that the nano-size NbC material was uniformly coated on the surface of CC. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor was evaluated in the range from -2V to + 2V and showed that the currents were spiked. To further understand the electrochemical behavior, the potentials were systematically reduced to +0.8V and evaluated. The charging-discharging behavior was studied systematically with the aim of avoiding the overestimation of the electrode performance. The specific capacitance was estimated to be around 27 F/g at the reduced potential window. Overall, this work presents a selection of the right potential window for the testing of the NbC based supercapacitor in such a way that avoids the overestimation of the potential window."

The investigation explores the self-sensing performance and electrical conductivity of smart ULW-ECC with seven CF lengths ranging from 1 to 20 mm. Initially, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity were assessed, followed by the impact of temperature and water content in composite on electrical conductivity. The self-sensing capability under both tension and flexure was examined, complemented by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) test. The density of smart ULW-ECC fell within the range of 1000–1200 kg/m<sup>3</sup> under the compressive strength of about 30 MPa. The integration of CF enhanced the compressive and flexural strength while reducing the tensile strain capacity. The electrical conductivity of the specimen with CF initially raised and then slightly declined with CF length from 1 to 20 mm, with the highest conductivity observed at 12 mm. Incorporating CF could diminish the influence of the environment on the electrical conductivity of ULW-ECC. Furthermore, the inclusion of CF improved the self-sensing performance of ULW-ECC, especially during the tensile strain-hardening (multiple microcracking) stage, although this efficacy was subject to variation based on CF length. Considering the mechanical, self-sensing, and conductive properties, it is recommended to utilize CF lengths within the range of 9–12 mm.

This in turn provided an understanding of the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of welded CoCuFeMnNi plates. Ageing treatment induces strengthening through a nanometric, maze-like structure resulting from spinodal decomposition, without affecting the grain structure. The dendritic microstructure is dissolved by solution treatment, which also activates the recrystallization of the melted zone, thus reducing the residual stresses caused by solidification. The local strengthening produced by spinodal decomposition, and the improved strain hardening capability resulting from grain refinement allow the melted zone to stand out in directly aged and solution-treated conditions, respectively."

The design approach starts by selecting a traditional, easy-to-manufacture parent lattice-based material that does not necessarily exhibit wide or functional band gaps. Subsequently, the parent lattice is transformed into a band-gap-rich lattice by superposing periodic triangular-shaped perturbations (i.e., zigzag-sine-based curvatures) with controllable frequencies and magnitudes on its ligaments. Finally, the frequency and magnitude parameters needed to deliver a specific band gap between 0 and 1000 kHz are determined using a hybrid intelligent framework, developed based on an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). The ANFIS network integrates fuzzy logic expert models and artificial neural networks’ machine learning capabilities. Such a hybrid network is known for its ability to model strongly nonlinear and complex data. The data used in training the ANFIS models is generated using parametric finite element-based simulations where band gaps corresponding to a wide range of perturbation frequencies and magnitudes are computationally determined. The parametric study showed a nonlinear and complex topology-band gap characteristic relation; however, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) proved capable of modeling the observed complex topology-band gap behavior efficiently. The accuracy of the ANFIS models exceeded 99 % in several design ranges (i.e., perturbation parameters ranges). These were designated as high-accuracy design regions and were highlighted in the proposed design approach. Using multiple case studies with different band gap requirements, the ANFIS-based design framework proved effective in delivering customized lattice-based metamaterials with user-defined band gap frequencies."

Initially, the effects of the carbon fibre (CF) content and the pre-heating temperature of CF on EMI SE of the matrix (named: ULW-CC) without polyethylene (PE) fibre were tested. Then, CFs (0.5 and 1.0 vol%) with seven lengths (1–20 mm) were respectively incorporated into ULW-ECC to study EMI SE. The EMI SE of ULW-ECC incorporating powder calcined petroleum coke (CPC) was compared with that of CF. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of conductive fillers improved the strength, conductivity, and EMI SE. Both the conductivity and EMI SE of ULW-CC and ULW-ECC increased with the dosage of conductive filler. EMI SE was enhanced with increased electrical conductivity, and pre-heating CF at 300 °C further improved the EMI SE. In ULW-ECC, 9-mm CF showed the highest EMI SE and conductivity. The conductivity and EMI SE of ULW-ECC were lower than those of ULW-CC at the same CF dosage due to the negative impact of PE fibre dispersion on the conductive network of CFs. The mixing method of CF in ULW-ECC affected the EMI SE. The EMI SE of ULW-ECC incorporating powder CPC was much lower than that incorporating CF, but hybridization of CPC and CF significantly enhanced EMI SE."

However, predicting the melting points of ILs poses a significant challenge due to their complex non-linear intermolecular interactions. Traditional methods, like molecular dynamics simulations require high computational time and costs along with the need for specialized force fields, which have given the rise to quantitative structure property relationship models. These models offer quick predictions but often fall short in accuracy and generalizability due to them needing special formulations or additions to account for the presence of different functional groups, thus struggling to fully capture the nuances of ionic liquid behavior. This limits their predictive effectiveness across varied IL systems. To address these challenges, we developed an encoder-based transformer model tailored for accurately predicting the melting points of ILs. Leveraging advanced attention mechanisms originally devised for natural language processing, this model discerns the contextual relationships among atoms within molecules. Specifically, we initially pre-trained the model on an extensive dataset of 1.8 billion molecules, followed by finetuning on a targeted dataset of ILs. This dual-phase training has allowed the model to capture complex chemical patterns and dependencies. In this work, our model achieved a remarkable R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.98 and a mean absolute error of 10.3 K, demonstrating its superior predictive accuracy over conventional ML models. This performance not only underscores the capability of model in enhancing the practical use of ILs across industries but also demonstrates its capacity to generalize across diverse chemical datasets."

    "abstract": "The ever-growing interest in additive manufacturing (AM) is evidenced by its extensive utilisation to manufacture a broad spectrum of products across a range of industries such as defence, medical, aerospace, automotive, and electronics. Today, most laser-based AM is carried out by employing continuous-wave (CW) and long-pulsed lasers. The CW and long-pulsed lasers have the downside in that the thermal energy imparted by the laser diffuses around the irradiated spot and often leads to the creation of heat-affected zones (HAZs). Heat-affected zones may degrade the material strength by producing micro-cracks, porous structures and residual stresses. To address these issues, currently, attempts are being made to employ ultrafast laser sources, such as femtosecond (fs) lasers, in AM processes. Femtosecond lasers with pulse durations in the order of 10<sup>−15</sup> s limit the destructive laser–material interaction and, thus, minimise the probability of the HAZs. This review summarises the current advancements in the field of femtosecond laser-based AM of metals and alloys. It also reports on the comparison of CW laser, nanosecond (ns)/picosecond (ps) lasers with fs laser-based AM in the context of heat-affected zones, substrate damage, microstructural changes and thermomechanical properties. To shed light on the principal mechanisms ruling the manufacturing processes, numerical predictions are discussed and compared with the experimental results. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this review is the first of its kind to encompass the current status, challenges and opportunities of employing fs lasers in additive manufacturing."

    "abstract": "Concrete 3D printing is a novel construction method that can bring new horizons to the construction industry. However, there are still many challenges that limit its capabilities. Despite the huge research efforts, to date, there are still no standardized acceptance criteria and guidelines for the evaluation of printing concrete. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to develop 3D printing mixes with different aggregate-to-binder (a/b) ratios (1.2, 1.5, and 1.8) and evaluate it in terms of its fresh printing properties, which include the workability, extrudability, setting time, open time, and buildability. The compressive strengths of cast and printed specimens were also tested to determine the effect of the layering process. The workability was evaluated using commonly used devices in the construction industry (slump and flow table test) and was monitored over time along with the penetration test to indicate the structuration rate of concrete. From the experimental results and observations, the flow test resulted in the best indication of the structuration rate (thixotropy) of concrete, followed by the penetration and slump tests. The a/b ratio affected all the investigated properties of the printing concrete. Higher a/b ratios resulted in increased structuration rate, buildability, and compressive strength of cast specimens. However, for printed specimens, the compressive strength decreased with the increase in a/b ratio due to increased thixotropy. Therefore, from the results of the present investigation, it can be concluded that high a/b ratios (>1.5) are not desirable for printing concrete."

Depending on the processing technique and process parameters various defects may arise. This research aims to find the best procedure to make FGMMCs with the highest quality and minimum cost. A new method is proposed that incorporates lost-foam and melt infiltration with semicentrifugal casting to produce FGMMC. Experiments were performed to in-situ fabricate 6061-Alumi-num alloy reinforced with gradient distributed Silicon carbide particles (Al/SiC FGMMC). Effect of SiC %, Al pouring temperature, and rotational speed on the fabricated specimens' hardness, strength, and reinforcement gradient were investigated using the design of experiments and regression analysis. Results reveal the optimum procedure and process settings based on desired properties/gradient required. Mathematical model formulated captures the effect of these process parameters on process cost, and cost of poor quality. Improper selection of these parameters may lead to extensive losses due cost of poor quality which is 12 times higher than the material cost. The proposed manufacturing process proved satisfactory in ensuring proper dispersion. A desirability function can be used to determine the process parameters and volume fraction that minimizes the defects and gives superior properties for a specific application."

However, their effect is influenced by the type of aggregate and the target concrete strength. This research investigates the effect of MAS on the mechanical performance of high-strength self-consolidating concrete (HSSCC). Two different types of coarse aggregates, natural quartz aggregate (NA) and recycled concrete aggregate (RA), were used in the evaluation. Compressive, splitting tensile, flexural, and shear strengths were tested and used as criteria for evaluation. Ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound value were also used as nondestructive evaluation techniques. The results showed that compressive strength decreased when using a bigger MAS of NA, while it increased when using a bigger MAS of RA. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized to include all mechanical properties of concrete, as the failure mechanism for each test depends on the type and size of aggregate. In addition, finite and discrete element methods were applied to study the effect of MAS as well as to simulate the experimental performance of concrete. Following proper proportioning and mixing, RA could be used to produce HSSCC concrete."

To further enhance their utility and increase the range of materials that they can process, this work proposes a low-cost solution that adapts to low-cost desktop-sized extruders and enables them to fabricate filaments comprising a wide range of nonorganic reinforcing particles. This solution will fill a gap in the field, as low-cost fabrication techniques for reinforced filaments have been lacking. In the proposed solution, particles are heated and deposited on thermoplastic pellets to form a coating. Coated pellets are subsequently extruded using a low-cost desktop single-screw extruder. The effectiveness of the process is demonstrated by fabricating polylactic acid (PLA) filaments reinforced with two types of reinforcements, namely, dune sand and silicon carbide. Filaments’ stiffness and strength were measured, and their microstructure along their lateral and longitudinal directions were investigated. Improvements in tensile strength (up to 8%) and stiffness (up to 4.5%) were observed, but at low reinforcement levels (less than 2 wt%). Results showed that the proposed process could be used to fabricate filaments with multiple types of particles. The produced filaments were successfully used to fabricate 3D parts using a commercial desktop FDM printer."

Although numerous image-based deep learning methods have been successfully developed to monitor and inspect AM product quality effectively, many require substantial labels in order to achieve satisfactory training, which is often impractical in real-life AM processes. In this article, a novel image feature-based self-supervised learning (IFSSL) model is proposed for effective quality inspection in AM. Through a feature-based image fusion approach based on defect-relevant feature extraction, the IFSSL model is able to guide machine vision to focus on highlighted defect-relevant regions in the AM product image. In addition, the defect-relevant features are used to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervised learning. With self-supervision, the IFSSL model leverages the advantages of supervised learning and unsupervised learning by requiring no sample label while retaining defect-relevant information. The effectiveness of the proposed IFSSL method is demonstrated through a real case study of fused deposition modeling product image dataset. Results show that the IFSSL model can guide machine vision to pay more attention to potential defective regions, enabling it to detect and locate faults effectively and automatically for machine vision guided quality inspection."

The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of grooving FRP materials within concrete substrates to achieve better bonding performance and superior flexural strength. The modeling process was conducted using the commercial software ABAQUS. Accordingly, two carbon-FRP (CFRP) concrete prism models underwent FE analysis to evaluate their performance. The FE results of the prisms showed that the predictable ultimate load for the prism externally grooved with CFRP laminate exhibited a notable 6% increase in comparison to the prism with CFRP externally bonded. While the percentage increase is not significant, it illustrates the potential of the grooved system to enhance the load-carrying capacity. The limited percentage increase is attributed to the modeling approach utilizing low-strength concrete. This suggests that the crushing failure mode may have approached closely to the debonding failure mode."

Nonetheless, realizing aerospace hybrid structures requires investigation into the process–structure–properties relationships of the AM and CM material and the interface zone between them. Herein, Inconel 718 is deposited onto extruded bars of the same material by powder bed fusion (PBF). The interface zone from the CM zone to the PBF zone is investigated using destructive and nondestructive testing. It is found that fractures during tensile tests occur in the CM zone. The PBF zone proves to be stronger than the CM zone (average yield strength of 1295 and 1167 MPa, respectively). A higher strength of PBF parts is related to the finer microstructure of δ-phase precipitates and dendrite cell structure. The fatigue limit of the hybrid samples is high (Sa = 305 MPa, R = 0.1). Coupled fatigue and digital image correlation at the highest stress amplitude show distinctive plastic flow dominating the CM zone. In reverse, fracture of hybrid parts at lower stress amplitudes forms preferentially in the PBF zone because of process-related defects (gas pores and lack of fusion)."

However, the fire performance of FRP-Reinforced Concrete (RC) members remains uncertain due to a lack of consistency in the limited available experimental results on concrete structural members with FRP subjected to elevated temperatures. This study consequently presents the flexural test results of eight steel and Basalt FRP (BFRP) RC prismatic beams exposed to elevated temperatures. The beams were subjected to target temperatures of 200, 400, and 700ºC before undergoing flexural testing. The experimental results revealed that the load-carrying capacity of steel RC beams decreased by a maximum of 35.5% at 400°C, while BFRP RC beams showed a 66.1% reduction at 700°C compared to those at room temperature. Overall, steel RC prismatic beams demonstrated a load-carrying capacity up to 60.5% higher than that of BFRP RC prismatic beams at all temperatures. Hence, beams with steel reinforcement can better withstand elevated temperatures compared to those with BFRP reinforcement, while BFRP RC beams still demonstrate acceptable performance."

This research investigates the impact of increasing the diameter of the inner steel bar of a glass SFCB on the bond stress between the bar and the surrounding concrete. Abaqus finite element software simulates the pullout behavior between glass SFCB and normal-strength concrete. Results of the FE models were compared with experimental results in terms of crack patterns and bond stresses. The FE model results correlated well with the experimental results having a 0.54% error in the ultimate bond stress and a 0.67% error in the corresponding slip. A parametric study is conducted in which the diameter of the inner steel core is increased while all other material properties and boundary conditions remain constant. The composite material's behavior is analyzed accounting for the interactions between the steel bar, glass FRP (GFRP) cover, and surrounding concrete. Notably, increasing the diameter of the inner steel bar from 8.6 mm to 12.6 mm increases the bond stress from 20.7 MPa to 25.1 MPa and increases the ultimate slip from 1.17 mm to 1.57 mm. The increase in ultimate slip is due to the rise in bond stress which in turn is due to a decrease in the radial confinement stress between the SFCB and the surrounding concrete."

    "abstract": "Anchor fan-to-sheet debonding remains one of the least understood yet critical failure mechanisms in externally bonded and anchored carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite strengthening systems. While other failure modes, such as fiber rupture and concrete cone pullout, have been extensively studied, limited attention has been given to the role of anchor fan geometry, including the synergistic effects of anchor fan angle and fan length, in governing FRP–FRP bond behavior and its contribution to this failure mechanism. To address this gap, an experimental investigation was conducted on CFRP-strengthened plain concrete prisms anchored using CFRP spike anchors with varied anchor fan geometries. A trigonometric approach was employed to systematically design anchor fan configurations for selected fan angles (30°, 45°, and 60°). Four-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of these geometries on load-bearing capacity, deflection, and CFRP strain. Results revealed that long and narrow anchor fans (SA-α30-F180 series) outperformed shorter and wider configurations (SA-α60-F85 series), highlighting the critical role of bonding length, represented by anchor fan length, and the influence of fan angle, which inherently governs fiber orientation. The FRP–FRP bond capacity was predicted using both the fracture energy model and the modified Adams model. The fracture energy model proved impractical for real-world applications due to its complexity and inability to account for the geometry of the anchor fan. In contrast, the modified Adams model aligned well with experimental results, though some limitations were identified, for which this study proposes improvements. Based on the findings, optimal anchor fan configurations are proposed. These recommendations, supported by experimental evidence and simplified predictive modelling, provide practical guidance for optimizing CFRP strengthening systems and improving the reliability of RC structures in real-world applications."

Key variables included the type of longitudinal bars (BFRP, GFRP, steel), transverse reinforcement material (BFRP or steel ties), tie spacing (180, 120, and 60 mm), and bar diameter (16 mm and 20 mm). Results showed that both steel and BFRP ties provided comparable axial capacity and confinement in FRP-RC columns.

    "abstract": "The fire performance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) or fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) systems remains a concern. For an FRP strengthening system to be considered effective during a fire, its fire performance must be defined using adequate fire protection. Without proper fire protection, FRP loses effectiveness early in a fire event. Four circular columns (800 mm in length) were exposed to ASTM E119 standard fire for 180 min with a sustained load equal to 13 % of their capacity. Carbon FRP wraps and FRCM with poly benzo isoxazole (PBO) grids were used for strengthening the columns. Two types of fire protection systems examined including spray applied fire-resistant material (SFRM) and intumescent paint (IP) coatings. Results showed significantly lower temperatures in columns wrapped with FRCM compared to the one wrapped with CFRP sheets. The SFRM-insulated column demonstrated superior performance, maintaining concrete core temperatures below 130 °C throughout the entire fire exposure period. A key observation was the quick ignition of the CFRP beneath the IP coating, which caused a rapid temperature increase, localized concrete spalling due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the CFRP sheets and concrete, and early exposure of the steel reinforcement. It is recommended to apply the IP coating carefully over combustible materials like FRP, as its fire protection capability may diminish within the first 30 min of the fire test. While SFRM performed well, combining FRCM with SFRM offers a more effective approach to enhancing the fire resistance of RC columns."

For such an irregular bridge, the girder distribution factors in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications are not applicable. In lieu of using a refined method of analysis, the study at hand proposes a simple approach for computing the dead and live load effect in the girders. To do so, fifteen composite steel girder bridges are analyzed by the finite element method to determine the influence of the girder flaring angle, girder spacing, number of girders, deck slab thickness, span length, girder stiffness, and presence of cross-bracing on the load distribution within the bridge. This study showed that the tributary width concept is a reliable approach for determining the dead load effect on the splayed girders, especially for the case of shored construction. The girder distribution factors for flexure in the AASHTO specifications can be reasonably utilized for such irregular bridges if the girder spacing at the location of each truck axle is considered, leading to a maximum of 14% difference on the conservative side between the AASHTO approach and the finite element analysis. On the other hand, the lever rule can provide a good estimate of the live load distribution among the splayed girders when subjected to shear, as the maximum safe deviation from the finite element outcome in this situation is less than 10%."

    "abstract": "Traditional methods of construction for reinforced concrete columns utilize longitudinal steel bars and transverse ties. Field experience has shown that such a transverse reinforcement method is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistencies in quality. Welded wire reinforcement (WWR) offers a prefabricated alternative, forming a closed cage that simplifies installation and speeds up the fabrication process. This study investigates the potential of using WWR as a replacement for conventional ties in reinforced concrete columns in pure compression. To achieve this objective, eight one-third-scale columns (1000 mm height, 200 × 200 mm cross-section) were tested under concentric axial loading inside a Universal Testing Machine. Four of the specimens contained WWR, while the other four had conventional ties. The variables that were considered in this study include the concrete compressive strength (34.3 and 43.5 MPa) and the grid size of the WWR (25 and 50 mm). This study investigated the influence of the type of transverse reinforcement on the strength, modulus of elasticity, and ductility of the confined concrete within the core. The findings of the study showed that lateral reinforcement in the form of WWR can increase the concrete core strength by 2.7% relative to corresponding columns employing ties when f′<inf>c</inf> = 34.3 MPa was used. Conversely, the utilization of ties proved to be more effective than WWR in improving concrete core strength by an average of 28.8% when f′<inf>c</inf> = 43.5 MPa was used. Additionally, WWR reinforced columns demonstrated a marginal 2.0% rise in the modulus of elasticity and a remarkable 21.0% increase in the ductility of the confined concrete core compared with corresponding tied columns. Theoretical predictions of the axial compressive capacity of WWR reinforced columns subjected to concentric loading based on the ACI-318 code provisions underestimated the experimental results by 20%. These findings demonstrate that WWR can serve as an effective substitute for conventional ties, particularly in cases where rapid installation and reduced labor costs are prioritized."

The experimental program adhered to the evaluation criteria outlined by ACI437R-03. Although the tested beams satisfied the repeatability limit specified by the committee, the deviation from linearity and permanency limits could not be satisfied. The performance of the beams was also evaluated in terms of load-deflection behaviour, stiffness degradation, energy dissipation, and brittleness. The hysteresis loops of the tested beams revealed significant differences in energy dissipation. Strengthened beams exhibited larger hysteresis loop areas, reflecting their enhanced energy absorption and dissipation capacity. In contrast, the control beam demonstrated smaller and narrower loops. The SMM beam consistently outperformed other configurations, achieving the highest flexural load-carrying capacity and dissipation energy. Post-cyclic monotonic loading tests further evaluated the residual behaviour of the beams. The percentage increase in flexural strength ranged from 38 to 51 % compared to the control unstrengthened beam.

A nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) was conducted using ABAQUS/CAE software 2020 to simulate the response of RC beams under these conditions. The results showed that the presence of web openings in RC beams reduced the ultimate load capacity and stiffness. However, the pre-stressed Fe-SMA reinforcement effectively mitigated these adverse effects, restoring much of the solid beam’s performance. Among the studied parameters, reducing the stirrup spacing significantly improved the load-bearing capacity, with the smallest spacing (100 mm) restoring 86% of the solid beam’s ultimate load. Increasing the Fe-SMA stirrup diameter further enhanced performance, with T16 stirrups recovering 92% of the solid beam’s ultimate load capacity. The most substantial improvement occurred when horizontal reinforcement was introduced, particularly with T16 stirrups, achieving a 95% load recovery, nearly matching the solid RC beam structural performance.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study on the flexural strengthening of RC beams using externally bonded CFRP sheets combined with carbon fiber anchors to prevent premature debonding and improve flexural capacity. Ten RC beams were externally strengthened with CFRP and anchored with different configurations of carbon fiber anchors. The behavior of the beams with anchors was compared to the behavior of a control beam without anchors and to a benchmark beam without strengthening. The anchor parameters tested in this experimental program include CFRP anchor diameter, embedment depth, fan length, and fan angle. The response of the tested beams was analyzed and discussed in terms of failure modes, load-deflection curves, flexural strength, ultimate strain in the CFRP laminates, and ductility. Test results showed that the application of end-anchorage can significantly enhance the flexural performance of CFRP-strengthened RC beams, increasing the ultimate load-carrying capacity and improving the beams behavior at failure. The anchored beams exhibited increases in ultimate load-carrying capacity ranging from 7 % to 32 %, with the highest improvements observed for beams with larger anchor diameters (24 mm). The study also highlights the need for prediction models to account for anchor contributions and calls for further experimental research to improve the reliability of design guidelines. These findings show that anchoring CFRP sheets effectively prevents premature debonding and ensures that RC beams can safely achieve higher flexural capacities and ductility in practice."

    "title": "Investigating Fracture Stiffness of Fiber Asphalt Mixtures with Various Mixing Processes Under Modes I/II using SBB Geometry at Low and Intermediate Temperatures — Akmal Abdelfatah",
    "abstract": "Enhancing the fracture stiffness of bituminous mixtures before cracking is essential to resist elastic deformations. Fibers have proven effective in enhancing the fracture properties of mixtures before cracking. This research aims to assess the effects of the mixing process of polypropylene fibers on the pre-cracking behavior of asphalt mixtures by analyzing pre-peak fracture energy index (Gfpre-peak), Tensile Strength Index (TSI), and Tensile Strength (TS) at temperatures of – 18 °C and + 25 °C (under Modes I and II). In this research, three groups of asphalt mixtures were strengthened by polypropylene fibers, with the reinforcement ratios of 0.5, 1.0% and 1.5% (based on aggregate weight). The resulting mixtures underwent testing using the Short Beam Bending (SBB) geometry. The results demonstrated an improvement in the elastic deformation resistance of bituminous mixtures, when polypropylene fibers were added using both the Sequential Mixing Process (SMP) and the Traditional Dry Mixing Process (TDMP), based on Gfpre-peak, TSI, and TS. The statistical analysis indicated a significant correlation between the TSI and TS values with Gfpre-peak indicator, highlighting a relationship between the Gfpre-peak indicator and fracture stiffness (elastic deformation resistance). In the SMP technique, the PP-1.5 mixture demonstrated the peak Gfpre-peak values under most testing conditions, with increases of 120% and 107% under Mode I and 22% and 96% under Mode II at − 18 °C and + 25 °C, respectively, compared to the base mixture findings. In contrast, in the TDMP technique, the PP-1 mixture enhanced Gfpre-peak with 160% and 163% under Mode I and with 91% and 100% under Mode II. Regarding fracture stiffness indexes, TSI and TS, a 1% fiber content exhibited peak findings in both SMP and TDMP mixtures under most testing conditions. Regression models with high R<sup>2</sup> values at + 25 °C indicated that fracture stiffness could be assessed using the fracture curve slope in SBB geometry. Asphalt mixtures reinforced with 1% polypropylene fibers through the SMP method showed high deformation resistance pre-and post-cracking under different loading conditions, making it the optimal approach."

Compressive strength was evaluated at each curing period, and data were analyzed using ASTM C1074 procedures alongside a computational model to determine the best-fit datum temperature and activation energy. The Nurse-Saul maturity method and Arrhenius equation were applied to estimate the equivalent age and maturity index of each mix. A predictive model was developed for geopolymer concrete prepared at an alkali-to-binder ratio of 0.45 and NaOH molarity of 12. The final equation demonstrated high accuracy, offering a reliable tool for predicting geopolymer strength under diverse curing conditions and providing valuable insights for optimizing geopolymer concrete formulations."

A hybrid system has been implemented by combining CFRP fabric bonded inside transverse grooves (EBRITG) with externally bonded layers over the grooves (EBROTG). Results demonstrated significant flexural capacity improvement—57% and 72.5% improvement with two and three CFRP layers, respectively—compared to the EBROG method, confirming the superior bonding efficiency. What is the implication of the main finding? Combining CFRP fabric using EBRITG with EBROTG method prevent the delamination of CFRP and significantly improved the bonding strength. Anchoring the concrete cover in the hybrid system has significantly enhanced the flexural performance of the strengthened beams. The use of a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) for structural strengthening has been widely adopted in recent decades. Early studies focused on externally bonded (EB) techniques, but premature delamination of CFRP from concrete surfaces often limited their efficiency. To address this, alternative methods, such as Externally Bonded Reinforcement Over Grooves (EBROG) and Externally Bonded Reinforcement Inside Grooves (EBRIG), were developed to enhance the bond strength and delay delamination. While most research has examined longitudinal groove layouts, this study investigates a hybrid system combining a CFRP fabric bonded inside transverse grooves (EBRITG) with externally bonded layers over the grooves (EBROTG). The system leverages the grooves’ surface area to anchor the CFRP and improve the bonding strength. Seven RC beams were tested in two stages: five beams with varied strengthening methods (EBROG, EBRIG, and hybrid) in the first stage and two beams with a hybrid system and concrete cover anchorage in the second stage. Results demonstrated significant flexural capacity improvement—57% and 72.5% increase with two and three CFRP layers, respectively—compared to the EBROG method, confirming the hybrid system’s superior bonding efficiency."

Multi-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the improvement mechanisms of ductility, self-healing, and microstructure in ECC. The results indicated that, although adding EV decreased the compressive strength from 85.7 MPa to 65 MPa, it remained suitable for high-strength concrete. The flaw-enhancing property of EV, which increases the probability of active flaws from 34 % to 45 %, along with its unique layered structure, significantly enhances the tensile strain capacity, increasing it from 2.53 % to 7.72 %. Meanwhile, the crack width was reduced from 115 μm to 67 μm. The tensile strength was observed to increase from 7.87 MPa to 9.21 MPa when the EV-to-sand replacement ratio reached 60 %. After 15 wet-dry cycles, EV-ECC and EV0 (reference mixture) formed self-healing products predominantly consisting of C-S-H gel and CaCO₃ crystals, respectively.

Finite element (FE) modeling and analysis depend on an accurate description of this bond-slip connection. This study represents the integration of experimental bond-slip models into finite element simulations of concrete prisms reinforced with carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) sheets. For CFRP-to-concrete joints, experimental bond tests were carried out in a three-point bending configuration to determine bond-slip relationships. Cohesive zone modeling approaches were then used to implement the resulting bond-slip curves into a nonlinear FE model. The experimental data from CFRP-strengthened concrete prisms tests under various conditions were used to verify the FE model. The findings demonstrate the ability of the proposed FE approach incorporating experimentally derived bond-slip models to accurately capture the complex behavior of CFRP-strengthened concrete elements including debonding failures. Moreover, this paper demonstrates the significance of accurate bond characterization and offers a framework for better finite element modeling of reinforced concrete structures using fiber-reinforced polymers, allowing for more accurate structural evaluations and design optimizations."

However, it exhibits poor performance under high temperatures due to its dense microstructure that leads to increased risk of explosive spalling. Studies also showed that HSC has higher degradation in its mechanical properties under elevated temperatures compared to normal-strength concrete. Therefore, synthetic fibers, such as polypropylene (PP) fibers are added to the concrete mix to reduce the extent of spalling and increase its fire resistance. This study aims to investigate the degradation in compressive strength properties of HSC, made of local materials in the UAE, with variable composition of PP fibers and steel fibers. Two mix designs were developed in this study. The first mix had 1% steel fibers only, and the second mix consisted of 1% steel fibers with 0.1% PP fiber. Results showed that specimens with steel fibers only exhibited the highest compressive strength at room temperature with the lowest residual The second mix provided comparable strengths to the first mix and acceptable strength degradation. Thus, it can be concluded that the design of the HSC mix can be utilized with the inclusion of synthetic fibers to enhance its fire resistance whilst maintaining its strength. Finally, material models for the degradation in the compressive strength of HSC are developed for the two mixes, respectively."

The dowel's diameter of the anchors used in this study is 14 and 20 mm, respectively. Results showed that the failure observed in the beam having inclined anchors was unfavorable. An abrupt separation in the concrete cover occurred that was even more brittle than the unanchored beam. Moreover, the percentage increase in flexural strength of the beam with inclined anchors was 23% with respect to the unanchored beam, compared to an increase of 40% demonstrated by the beam with vertical anchors. Therefore, it can be concluded that using inclined anchors is not recommended in strengthened RC beams for flexure."

The results demonstrated that corrosion of reinforcement reduced the column's axial strength by up to 40 %, but both repair systems restored the original capacity. The C-FRP repair technique provided superior strength enhancement (118 %–131 % increase) compared to that of C-FRCM (51 %–71 % increase) due to better confinement effectiveness. However, the columns repaired with C-FRCM exhibited a more gradual post-peak degradation, contributing to improved ductility. A new analytical model was proposed and validated against test results to predict the axial strength of the columns before and after repair. The model accounts for corrosion effects and the interaction between the internal steel tie confinement and external composite wrapping, providing a comprehensive and realistic assessment of the column's strength. The findings support the use of advanced composites in the practical rehabilitation of corrosion-damaged RC columns."

Recently, new emerging composite materials known as galvanized steel mesh (GSM) sheets, which are comprised of unidirectional ultrahigh-strength steel wire meshes, are gaining considerable attention in strengthening applications. The main aim of this paper is to compare the test results of RC beams strengthened with medium-density GSM (MSM) and high-density (HSM) laminates with that of CFRP laminates. Accordingly, a total of six RC beams were strengthened in flexure with equivalent CFRP, MSM, and HSM laminates, in addition to two control unstrengthened beam specimens. All beam specimens were subjected to symmetrical monotonic loading testing, and strain data were recorded along with deflection at the beams midspan. Experimental results showed that HSM laminates enhanced the flexural strength, stiffness, cracking performance, energy absorption, and ductility of RC beams compared with CFRP and MSM laminates. In addition, flexural bond tests were conducted on prism samples to compare the bond behavior between each of the three laminates and concrete interface. The test results also showed that HSM laminates failed at higher attained load levels than CFRP and MSM laminates. Current design guidelines were also used to predict the nominal flexural capacity of the control and strengthened RC beams. The results showed that the predicted ultimate load is in good agreement with the experimental results and the difference was in the range of 0.4%-4%, respectively. Therefore, it has been concluded that GSM laminates can be used as an effective composite material for flexural strengthening of RC beams."

Reactive powder concrete (RPC) is an UHPC in which traditional coarse aggregates are replaced by fine aggregates. The main purpose of this research is to produce RPC using dune sand and to study its microstructure and mechanical properties under different curing conditions of water curing and hot air curing. The effects of these factors are studied over a long-term period of 90 days. Quartz sand is completely replaced by a blend of crushed and dune sand, and cement is partially replaced by using binary blends of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash (FA), which are used alongside silica fume (SF) to make a ternary supplementary binder system. Microstructural analysis is conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and engineering properties like compressive strength and flexural strength are studied to evaluate the performance of dune sand RPC. Overall, the results affirm that the production of UHPC is possible with the use of dune sand. The compressive strength of all mixes exceeded 120 MPa after 12 h only of hot air curing (HAC). The SEM results revealed the dense microstructure of RPC. However, goethite-like structures (corrosion products) were spotted at 90 days for all HAC specimens. Additionally, the use of FA accelerated the formation of such products as compared to GGBS. The effect of these products was insignificant from a mechanical point of view.

There is currently an increased use of FRP-reinforced concrete structures worldwide.

This study aims at investigating the feasibility of using glass FRP (GFRP) bars as internal reinforcement in concrete columns, subject to concentric and eccentric loading. A total of four 180 mm × 180 mm square RC columns with heights of 1000 mm and 1100 mm were tested, including two GFRP-RC columns and two steel-RC columns. One GFRP-RC column was tested under concentric loading, and the other was tested under eccentric loading at an eccentricity-to-width ratio of 44.4%. The two steel-RC columns were replicates of the two GFRP-RC columns, and served as control specimens. All columns were cast with normal strength concrete of 34 MPa compressive strength and had the same longitudinal reinforcement ratio of 2.48%. Steel ties of 10 mm diameter spaced at 180 mm were used as transverse reinforcements in all columns. The results showed that GFRP-RC columns had lower load-carrying capacities than their steel-RC counterparts under both concentric and eccentric loadings. The ultimate capacities of GFRP-RC columns were 22% and 34% lower than their steel-RC counterparts at concentric and eccentric loadings, respectively. Also, the GFRP- and steel-RC columns exhibited similar modes of failure, which were mainly compression-controlled with concrete cover spalling and concrete crushing, under the different loading conditions. No rupture or buckling of longitudinal bars was observed. The contribution of GFRP bars to the ultimate column capacity under concentric loading, was found to be around 10.5%.

However, few tests were conducted to study the effect of the FRP anchors on the strength and ductility of RC beams externally strengthened in shear with CFRP sheets. In addition, there are no design guidelines for the anchors in the current strengthening design codes of practice. For the aforementioned reasons, one-point loading tests were conducted on six shear deficient RC T-beams. Five specimens were strengthened with U-Wrapped CFRP laminates, four of which were anchored with different configurations of CFRP splay anchor systems, and one T-beam was left unstrengthened to serve as a benchmark specimen.

The shear capacity of a joint is influenced by the concrete’s compressive strength, the anchoring of longitudinal beam reinforcement, the number of stirrups in the joint, and the junction’s aspect ratio. Seismic motion on the beam may produce shear capacity and bond breaking in the joint, causing the joint to fracture. Furthermore, due to inadequate joint design and details, the entire structure is jeopardized. In this study, the specimens were divided into two groups for corner and interior beam–column joints based on the joint reinforcement detailing. The controlled specimen has joint detailing as per IS 456:2000, and the strengthened specimen has additional diagonal cross bars (modified reinforcement technique) at the joints detailed as per IS 456:200. The displacement time history curve, load‐displacement response curves, load‐displacement hysteretic curve, and load cycle vs. shear stress were used to compare the results of the controlled and strengthened spec-imens. The findings show that adding diagonal cross bars (modified reinforcing techniques) to beam–column joints exposed to cyclic loads enhances their performance. The inclusion of a diagonal cross bar increased the stiffness of the joint by giving an additional mechanism for shear transfer and ductility, as well as greater strength with minimum cracks."

All columns had a clear height of 800 mm and were tested monotonically until failure. Results showed that for columns wrapped with two PBO-FRCM layers, using a tie spacing of 90 mm eliminated the effect of varying the cross section. However, circular columns showed a higher increase in capacity than square columns for a tie spacing of 180 mm, where the increase was 40%. For all columns wrapped with four PBO-FRCM layers, the cross-section shape was the sole influence on ultimate capacity, where circular columns noticeably showed a more improved capacity. Also, column load-strain relationships were only influenced by the tie spacing. All strengthened columns showed improved ductility with the increase in PBO-FRCM layers. Using existing design provisions, the theoretical capacity of the columns was calculated, and results showed that the code underestimates ultimate capacity, where the theoretical capacities were lower than the experimental ones by 5%-20%."

However, limited research efforts and codes provisions deal with retrofitting and strengthening of lightweight concrete structures. Therefore, the main objective of this investigation is to evaluate the flexural performance of all lightweight concrete (ALWC) beams externally strengthened using Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheets. A total of fifteen ALWC beams were divided into three series based on their reinforcement ratio and strengthened with externally bonded CFRP sheets. The test variables studied in the experimental program were the effective reinforcement ratio, number of CFRP layers, and the percentage of pre-loading. All the beams were tested under four-point bending and the experimental results show that the CFRP sheet has significantly increased the ultimate load carrying capacity of pre-loaded and non-preloaded strengthened specimens. The increase in flexural capacity ranged from 28% to 102% over the unstrengthened control specimen. The ultimate load capacity was also predicted using different design standards and compared with the experimental load. The comparison showed that the current design standards have overestimated the flexural capacity of CFRP strengthened ALWC specimens."

The flexural behavior of RC beams strengthened with one and two layers of PET-FRP was compared to that strengthened with one carbon FRP (CFRP) layer and an unstrengthened beam specimen. Test results showed that the specimens strengthened with two PET-FRP layers and one CFRP layer displayed equal and significant strength enhancement of 47% compared to the unstrengthened beam. However, the former exhibited higher ductility than the latter by 33%. Lower strength enhancement was depicted in the specimen strengthened with one PET-FRP layer. Despite that, the ductility of the PET-strengthened beam was substantial, which even outweighed that of the unstrengthened beam by 9%. The results of this study showed that PET-FRP is a promising strengthening material that improves structural performance and provides a sustainable alternative to conventional FRP strengthening systems."

The variables of the experimental program included the beam depth, the concrete compressive strength, and the flexural fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement ratio. It was observed that the strengthened beams exhibited up to 35% increase in shear capacity over the control beams. It was also observed that the increase in shear strength provided by concrete after strengthening was higher for beams with normal strength concrete when compared to those with higher strength concrete. The results have also revealed that the percent change in shear strength provided by concrete for the strengthened beams decreased with the increase in beam depth. Experimental data from this study showed that current standards become unconservative for beams with large depths. Five different beam shear strength models found in the literature were utilized to predict the shear strength of the tested beams. The models that exhibited the closest agreement with the experimental data were those of the University of Houston and the second order simplified modified compression field theory. It was concluded that flexural longitudinal NSM bars are a viable solution to enhance the shear strength of RC beams and that the shear strength provided by concrete can be accurately quantified using published models."

    "abstract": "Last few years have seen a substantial growth in the development and application of lightweight concrete (LWC) due to its enhanced mechanical properties and economic benefits in comparison to conventional normal weight concrete (NWC). The use of LWC in infrastructure has been popularised, especially in long-span bridges and high-rise bridges due to its lower density, which significantly reduces the dead load on the structure. Carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) have rapidly gained acceptance in the infrastructure industry for their desirable characteristics over traditional steel. Extensive experimental research has been carried out over to years to investigate the shear performance of externally strengthened NWC beams with CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) strips. However, very limited research has been conducted on the shear performance of GFRP reinforced LWC beams externally strengthened with CFRP strips. Therefore, the main objective of this experimental study is to investigate the shear performance of high strength lightweight self-compacting concrete (HLWSCC) beams reinforced with internal GFRP bars and strengthened with external CFRP strips. HLWSCC is the latest development in concrete technology that combines the benefit of LWC and self-compacting concrete (SCC). One control specimen and two shear deficient HLSCC beams were strengthened with CFRP strips in the shear span. The test variable studied was the strip orientation (u-wrap and 45°) and all beams subjected to static four-point bending test. Load-deflection response and failure modes were observed and recorded for all the tested specimen. CFRP strips has considerably increase the load carrying capacity of HLWSCC strengthened beam specimen. The percentage increase in nominal shear strength ranged from 58.7% to 73.4% over unstrengthened control specimen."

Researchers have attempted to perform comparative analyses on the behavior of UHPC versus conventional and high‐strength concrete, with their aim being to gain more insights into the difference between different types of concrete. However, the current state‐of‐the‐art revealed no direct comprehensive comparisons between their behaviors in ductile coupled shear walls under seismic loading. This paper explores a comprehensive side‐by‐side comparison in terms of seismic behavior and cost analysis for four 60‐story archetype buildings. The reference building was designed using high‐strength concrete with a strength of 60 MPa. The other three archetype variations incorporated three different UHPC grades: 150 MPa, 185 MPa, and 220 MPa. The plan configuration and the lateral force‐resisting system (LFRS) were chosen according to the most common practice in the UAE. The main objective is to report the effect of UHPC on the LFRS (ductile coupled shear walls). Moreover, a simplified initial cost analysis (materials and labor) design was performed. The findings of this paper indicate that the use of UHPC is capable of improving the seismic performance behavior of the lateral system as well as reducing the total initial costs."

The soil used to cast the earth blocks was composed of dune sand, which is extensively available in the United Arab Emirates and most Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) deserts, and clayey silt soil acquired from Al-Ain city, UAE. Sixteen different mixes were prepared for this study. Two identical earth blocks were cast in a wooden mold from each mix to form a total of 32 blocks. After compaction, the blocks were consolidated under pre-specified pressure, air dried, and tested to failure in the compression machine. The main parameters investigated in this study were clay content, fiber types and percentages, and cement content. The results indicate that the addition of natural or polymeric fiber to cast earth blocks significantly improved their compressive strength. The maximum compressive strength of improved blocks showed an increase of more than 30% above the maximum compressive strength recorded for identical soil blocks without fiber. In addition, the post-peak and pre-peak strength behaviors of the earth blocks are different with different fiber contents. Finally, the addition of 0.5% cement to the fiber-reinforced blocks showed a negligible effect on the peak compressive strength. However, cement content improved the early stage (small strain) stiffness of earth blocks."

As such, galvanized steel mesh (GSM) has emerged as an option in the strengthening of RC structures. Although numerous studies were performed on GSM strengthened RC beams, the durability of such strengthening systems is yet to be fully understood. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study to investigate the strengthening effect of GSM on RC beams as well as the time-depended behavior of RC beams with and without strengthening. Reinforced concrete beams without strengthening were used as control beams. For the strengthened beams, both high cord density galvanized steel mesh (HSM) and medium cord density galvanized steel mesh (MSM) were used after which the beams were exposed to Qatar atmospheric environment for different periods of time following 28 days of water curing. Finite element analyses using ABAQUS software were conducted to predict the mechanical behavior of the RC beams with and without strengthening. The results showed an improvement ranging from 46% ∼ 57% in the ultimate load of GSM strengthened beams, with a higher initial cracking load ranging from 3% ∼ 35% when compared to the unstrengthened beams. On the other hand, the time-dependent effect of the concrete has limited influence on the initial cracking load of both systems (before and after strengthening) while the ultimate load increased gradually with time due to the strength development of concrete. The results obtained from this study are useful in improving the design, construction, and maintenance of RC beams strengthened with GSM laminates."

Some of its main disadvantages include its high cement and SF content, fine quartz with a preferred size of 150 µm - 600 µm, and low water-to- binder ratio. These characteristics increase the cost of RPC production and affect sustainable development. Because of this, researchers have resorted to exploring substitutes to cement and quartz to produce an eco-friendlier type of RPC. Accordingly, this research aims to study the compressive strength development of RPC prepared with dune sand and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). Three main factors were investigated including 1) replacing cement with 30% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), 2) using ternary blends of GGBS and fly ash (FA) in RPC, and 3) applying 100°C hot air curing (HAC) to RPC. Overall, the results showed that the compressive strength of HAC and water cured specimens exceeded 120 MPa after 12 hours and 28 days, respectively. Moreover, the compressive strength development of the mixes incorporating SCM was slower than that of the control mix incorporating cement only under HAC conditions."

    "abstract": "Reinforced Concrete structures face adverse deterioration during their life cycle. Fiber reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) is a strengthening system combining fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bonded with traditional cement-based mortar. This strengthening system is easy to apply and eliminates the toxic hazard associated with epoxy bonded FRP. ABAQUS is used to develop nonlinear three-dimensional finite element (FE) models to investigate the potential of this novel retrofitting system to restore the original axial capacity and behavior of corrosion pre-damaged slender circular reinforced concrete columns. Poly-paraphenylene-ben-zobisoxazole (PBO) fibers are used in the strengthening system due to favorable mechanical properties. Nonlinearities in concrete, cementitious matrix and PBO fibers are accounted for in the FE model. Published literature is used to verify the FE models based on column axial capacity and observed failure mode. A parametric study is carried out through varying the number FRCM layers (1, 2, 3 and 4), corrosion pre-damage level (30%, 50% and 70%), slenderness ratio (short/800mm and slender/1200mm) and ratio of eccentricity (0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5). Compressive strength of 30 MPa is used in all columns and along with 2% reinforcement ratio and recommended CDP parameters. Results are presented and contrasted and the potential of the novel retrofitting system to repair and enhance the behavior of slender circular columns is evaluated."

    "abstract": "When it comes to sustainability, steel rebar corrosion has always been a big issue, especially when they are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as marine and coastal environments. Moreover, the steel industry is to blame for being one of the largest producers of carbon in the world. To supplant this material, utilizing fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) and hybrid FRP bars as a reinforcement in concrete elements is proposed because of their appropriate mechanical behavior, such as their durability, high tensile strength, high-temperature resistance, and lightweight-to-strength ratio. This method not only improves the long performance of reinforced concrete (RC) elements but also plays an important role in achieving sustainability, thus reducing the maintenance costs of concrete structures. On the other hand, FRP bars do not show ductility under tensile force. This negative aspect of FRP bars causes a sudden failure in RC structures, acting as a stumbling block to the widespread use of these bars in RC elements. This research, at first, discusses the effects of different environmental solutions, such as alkaline, seawater, acid, salt, and tap water on the tensile and bonding behavior of different fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars, ranging from glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars, and basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars, to carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars, and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (AFRP) bars. Furthermore, the influence of the hybridization process on the ductility, tensile, and elastic modulus of FRP bars is explored. The study showed that the hybridization process improves the tensile strength of FRP bars by up to 224% and decreases their elastic modulus by up to 73%. Finally, future directions on FRP and hybrid FRP bars are recommended."

    "title": "Performance of Different Concrete Types Exposed to Elevated Temperatures: A Review — Sherif Yehia",
    "abstract": "Concrete is a heterogeneous material that consists of cement, aggregates, and water as basic constituents. Several cementitious materials and additives are added with different volumetric ratios to improve the strength and durability requirements of concrete. Consequently, performance of concrete when exposed to elevated temperature is greatly affected by the concrete type. Moreover, post-fire properties of concrete are influenced by the constituents of each concrete type. Heating rate, days of curing, type of curing, cooling method, and constituents of the mix are some of the factors that impact the post-fire behavior of concrete structures. In this paper, an extensive review was conducted and focused on the effect of concrete constituents on the overall behavior of concrete when exposed to elevated temperature. It was evident that utilizing fibers can improve the tensile capacity of concrete after exposure to higher temperatures. However, there is an increased risk of spalling due to the induced internal stresses. In addition, supplementary cementitious materials such as metakaolin and silica fume enhanced concrete strength, the latter proving to be the most effective. In terms of the heating process, it was clear that several constituents, such as silica fume or fly ash, that decrease absorption affect overall workability, increase the compressive strength of concrete, and can yield an increase in the strength of concrete at 200 °C. Most of the concrete types show a moderate and steady decrease in the strength up until 400 °C. However, the decrease is more rapid until the concrete reaches 800 °C or 1000 °C at which it spalls or cannot take any applied load. This review highlighted the need for more research and codes’ provisions to account for different types of concrete constituents and advanced construction materials technology."

Tests for the waste material included visual examination, chemical composition, grain size distribution, specific gravity, and fineness modulus. Tests on the incorporated recycled fine aggregate in new concrete mixes involved tests of the hardened plain concrete product. In total, eight concrete mixes were considered, of which four had low cement content with 30 MPa target strength, and the other four had high cement content with 55 MPa target strength. For each cement content, the four concrete mixes incorporated fine aggregate replacement ratios of 0% (control), 25%, 50%, and 100%. The hardened concrete tests involved cubes, cylinders, and prisms. The tests addressed compressive strength, tensile strength, and modulus of rupture in accordance with the relevant ASTM standards. In all cases, the average of two tested samples at the age of 28 days was considered. Results of the study showed that the recycled fine aggregate has some cementitious properties, which is capable of hardening when mixed with water and left to dry, even without adding cement from exterior sources. All tested concrete specimens made with recycled fine aggregate exhibited compressive and tensile strengths at least equal to 75% that of the control specimens that contained natural fine aggregate. However, for concrete mixes utilizing low cement content that can yield a compressive strength around 30 MPa with natural aggregate, replacement of 25% or 100% of the natural fine aggregate by weight with locally produced recycled fine aggregate from crushed old concrete can match and often exceeds the compressive and tensile strength of concrete made with virgin aggregate."

The numerical model results in terms of load-deflection behavior, and ultimate loads are verified using previously published experimental data in the literature. The numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental results. The FE model is then employed in a parametric study to inspect the effect of concrete compressive strength on the performance of RC thin slabs strengthened with different FRP types, namely carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP), polyethylene terephthalate fiber-reinforced polymers (PET-FRP), basalt fiber-reinforced polymers (BFRP) and glass fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP). The results showed that the highest strength enhancement was obtained by the slab that was strengthened by CFRP sheets. Slabs that were strengthened with other types of FRP sheets showed an almost similar flexural capacity. The effect of concrete compressive strength on the flexural behavior of the strengthened slabs was moderate, with the highest effect being a 15% increase in the ultimate load between two consecutive values of compressive strength, occurring in the CFRP-strengthened slabs. It can thus be concluded that the developed FE model could be used as a platform to predict the behavior of reinforced concrete slabs when strengthened with different types of FRP composites.

Effects of metakaolin, w/b ratio and different types of fibers on concrete properties were investigated.

In addition, it was found that long polypropylene (LPP) fibers increased the splitting tensile strength of HFLWC by 71 % and reached 136 % of equivalent flexural strength ratio of HFLWC compared to the control mix. Moreover, flexural strength of HFLWC with 2 % volumetric ratio of LPP fiber was better than that of the short polypropylene (SPP).

This paper presents the results of an experimental and analytical study to evaluate the shear performance of HLWSCC beams internally reinforced with CFRP sheet stirrups. In addition to one control specimen, seven beams were cast and reinforced with CFRP sheet stirrups. The variables studied in the experimental program were the number of layers, strip spacing, strip (sheet) width, and strip configuration of CFRP stirrups. All the beams were subjected to four-point bending, and the experimental results include load–deflection response curves and strain values along with the failure modes. Experimental results showed that all the tested beams failed due to shear tension failure. However, some of the specimens also failed due to the rupture of CFRP sheet stirrups. The addition of CFRP sheet stirrups has substantially increased the shear capacity of HLWSCC beams and the increase in shear strength ranged from 64% to 140% over the control specimens. Additionally, the nominal shear strength was predicted using various Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) design standards, including ACI 440.1R-15, CSA S806-12, CSA S6-14, CNR-DT (2013), JSCE, and Fib Bulletin 40.

The workability is assessed using commonly used devices in the construction (slump & flow table test) and is monitored over time to indicate the structuration rate of concrete. The results show that 1) the flow test gives a better indication of the structuration rate of concrete as compared to the slump test, 2) as the a/b ratio increases, the structuration rate of concrete also increases, and 3) increasing the a/b ratio increases the buildability and compressive strength of cast specimens and lowers the compressive strength of printed specimens.

The numerical results of the validated specimens showed good agreement with the experimental ones. Then, the proposed concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model was used to examine the effect of various influential parameters, such as the shear span-to-height ratio (a/H), opening size, opening location, concrete compressive strength (f<inf>c</inf><sup>'</sup>), main reinforcement ratio (ρ<inf>s</inf>), and web reinforcement ratio (ρ<inf>web</inf>). It was found that the presence of openings impairs the bearing capacity of RC deep beams, especially openings with sizes of 0.3 and 0.4 of the overall height of the beam. Moreover, openings located through the shear zone significantly reduce the ultimate load, especially on the loading path and near the bearing plates. This is due to the high concentration of shear cracks at the corners of the openings through the loading path line. The behavior of RC deep beams with web openings mainly depends on the openings’ size and location. In addition, decreasing the shear span-to-height ratio increases the ultimate load. Meanwhile, increasing the concrete compressive strength (f<inf>c</inf><sup>'</sup>) increases the ultimate load. Similarly, increasing the main reinforcement ratio leads to a higher ultimate load due to adequate cracking control. The same finding can be revealed for the influence of the web reinforcement ratio on the bearing capacity of RC deep beams with web openings. Increasing the main reinforcement ratio from 0.45% to 0.57% and increasing the web reinforcement ratio from 0.29% to 0.33% can enhance the bearing capacity of RC deep beams by 11.36% and 3.26%, respectively. Finally, the numerical investigation reveals that the proposed simulated model can be used to effectively investigate the behavior of RC deep beams with openings overcoming their complexity."

Fe-SMA bars can produce pre-stressing forces on reinforced concrete members by activating their shape memory phenomenon upon heating. This study aims to numerically evaluate the impact of pre-stressed Fe-SMA bars on the structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams at the serviceability and ultimate stages. Nonlinear finite element (FE) models were developed to predict the response of RC beams externally strengthened with Fe-SMAs. The model shows to correlate well with published experimental results. A parametric investigation was also carried out to examine the effect of various concrete grades, pre-stressing levels, and Fe-SMA bars’ diameter on load-deflection behavior. In light of the innovative nature of the Fe-SMA strengthening technique, a comparison investigation was established between RC beams strengthened with Fe-SMA bars against different pre-stressing systems, such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars, glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars, and steel strands. The numerical findings showed a significant increase in the beams’ load-carrying capacity with larger Fe-SMA bars’ diameter. Specifically, using 12 mm Fe-SMA bars instead of 6 mm increased the beam’s strength by 73%. However, a 14% reduction in ductility was recorded for that case. Moreover, the pre-stressing level of Fe-SMA bars and concrete grade showed a negligible effect on the ultimate strength of the examined beams. Moreover, increasing the pre-stressing level and concrete strength significantly enhanced the load-deflection response in the serviceability stage. Furthermore, using 2T22 mm of Fe-SMA bars resulted in a better structural performance of RC beams compared to other techniques with 2T12 mm, with a comparable cost. Thus, it can be concluded that using Fe-SMA bars embedded in a shotcrete layer attached to the beam’s soffit is a viable and promising strengthening strategy. Nevertheless, further experimental investigations are recommended to further ascertain the reported findings of this numerical investigation."

    "abstract": "Light weight construction using Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bars and structural light weight concrete (LWC) have increased recently and offers a wide spectrum of advantages over traditional normal weight concrete (NWC) structures. However, the shear strengthening and rehabilitation performance of LWC beams reinforced with GFRP bars is very limited and currently there are no guidelines related to it. Therefore, this study presents the results of an experimental investigation on the shear strengthening behaviour of lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) beams reinforced with GFRP bars. The test parameters studied in the experimental program were the longitudinal reinforcement ratio and strip configuration or orientation. A total of twelve shear deficient GFRP reinforced beams were prepared with a shear span to depth ratio of 3.12 and subjected to static four-point bending. Five beams in each series were externally strengthened with different configurations of Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips and one beam served as a control specimen to compare the performance of the strengthened specimens. Crack patterns, load–displacement response curves, and strain in the external CFRP strips were recorded until the failure ultimate load. The results of the experimental study indicated that the external CFRP strips improved the nominal shear capacity of GFRP reinforced LWSCC beams, and the contribution of external CFRP strips was sensitive to the reinforcement ratio. The nominal shear capacity of the strengthened specimens increased from 33.3 to 168% compared to the control specimen. U-wraps with horizontal strips in the compression and tension zone were the most effective configuration, showing the highest increase in shear strength compared to other strengthened specimens. Moreover, the shear capacity was theoretically predicted using different Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) design standards and guidelines which were compared with the experimental results. All the FRP design standards have overestimated the shear capacity of LWSCC beams, and a modified equation with a set of recommendations was proposed based on the experimental study. In addition, a reduction factor of 0.75 is recommended for conservative design."

    "title": "Flexural behavior of circular concrete filled steel tubes with partially incorporated demolished concrete lumps — Farid Abed",
    "abstract": "For the past decade, researchers have been experimenting with the use of Demolished Concrete Lumps (DCLs) in structural members, as it has been proven to be a promising method to recycle concrete in different field applications. Although there have been several studies on incorporating DCLs in Concrete Filled Steel Tube (CFST) members, there are no studies that evaluate its effect on the flexural performance of CFST beams. Therefore, this paper focuses on studying the flexural behavior of CFST beams with DCLs, where the DCLs are inserted at the center of the cross-section. In total, fourteen circular CFST and two circular Steel Tube (ST) specimens were tested under bending using a four-point loading setup. The specimens are categorized into two different steel tube sections, where two circular sections of D/t = 55 (C1) and D/t = 45 (C2) were considered. The CFST specimens within each steel tube category differ in DCLs particle sizes and DCLs inner occupation area. CFST beams filled completely with normal concrete were also tested as control specimens. In addition, two CFST specimens from the steel section C2 were left partially hollow at the center to study the contribution of DCLs to the overall flexural performance. The results were very promising as the flexural behavior of DCL CFST specimens was very similar to the control CFST specimens. The DCLs’ particle sizes and the inner occupation area had minimal effect on the ductility, stiffness, yielding capacity, and ultimate capacity of the CFST specimens. The maximum percentage reduction in the flexural capacity between DCL CFST and control specimens were less than 2% for both sections whereas the percentage gain was up to 7%. Furthermore, the obtained flexural capacities were compared with nominal predictions from different design codes and models. All codes underestimated the capacities of all CFST specimens, with Han's model being the most conservative, followed by EC4, BS-5400–5, and AISC-LRFD, respectively."

    "abstract": "Eco-friendly concrete that considers waste material and requires less energy for production is in demand because it produces less carbon dioxide, reduces the consumption of raw material, and can be a cheaper option to conventional concrete. The objectives of this study are to investigate the shear behavior of reinforced concrete beams made with locally produced recycled coarse aggregate from construction demolition waste, study the important parameters that affect the shear strength and ductility, and check the applicability of the available theoretical shear strength predictive equations to recycled concrete. An experimental program that involved the testing of fifteen half-scale beams in shear without stirrups was carried out with a theoretical component. Results of the study showed that recycled concrete beams employing 50% recycled coarse aggregate had on average 27% lower shear strength than corresponding beams made with natural aggregate when tested at a shear span-to-depth ratio equal to 1.15, and almost the same strength as the natural aggregate beams when subjected to a shear span-to-depth ratio equal to 2.5. On the other hand, the average shear strength of beams utilizing 100% recycled aggregate was lower by 5% than the strength of their natural aggregate counterparts, irrespective of the shear span-to-depth ratio. The longitudinal steel reinforcement ratio had less effect on the shear strength provided by recycled concrete beams than on those made with natural aggregate, possibly due to the reduced ability of such concrete to develop strong dowel action. Although the use of higher strength concrete improved the shear strength of recycled aggregate beams, there was no clear correlation between the square-root of the concrete compressive strength and the shear strength provided by the concrete. The theoretical part of the study showed that the ACI 318 code and the strut-and-tie method can be reliably used to predict the shear strength of concrete made with recycled coarse aggregate employed in shallow and deep beams, respectively."

    "abstract": "Reinforced concrete (RC) structures deteriorate over time and therefore, need to be strengthened. Despite the fact that RC structurtes have a decent fire rating, the performance of the strengthening system under fire exposure needs to be evaluated. One of the main restrictions associated with Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) systems is their poor resistance to high temperatures, which originates from the combustible polymer matrix. Therefore, Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) systems have been introduced due to their improved performance during fire exposure. The potential of Poly-paraphenylene-ben-zobisoxazole (PBO) FRCM to strengthen circular RC columns is evaluated using a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA). The commericial software ABAQUS is used to develop 3D FE models to investigate the axial performance of the strengthening system. The modeling approach is performed by first conducting a thermal analysis to generate the nodal tempertaures. The second step of the model includes a displacement-controlled loading condition with imported nodal temperatures from the first model. The temperature dependent material properties are incorporated in both models. The modeling approach is validated against published literature and a parametric study is conducted on PBO FRCM strengthened and unstrengthened columns heated at durations of 1, 2, and 4 hours following the ASTM standard fire temperature-time curve. Results indicated a decrease in the axial capacity and stiffness of the strengthened and unstrengthened columns upon heating. Moreover, an increase in the columns’ ductility due to the increase in temperature was observed. A decrease in ultimate strength of up to 78 and 68% was observed for the unstrengthened and strengthened columns respectively."

In this paper, a reliable and practical numerical methodology was introduced to facilitate the whole process of fire simulations and increase the practicality of performing comprehensive parametric studies in the future. These parametric studies are crucial for understanding the factors that affect thermal–structural responses and avoiding the high cost of destructive tests. The proposed algorithm comprises a fully nonlinear coupled thermal-stress analysis involving thermal and structural material nonlinearity and the thermal–structural response during a fire. A detailed numerical modeling analysis was performed with ABAQUS to achieve the proposed algorithm. The results of the proposed numerical methodology were validated against published experimental work. The experimental work includes a full-scale RC beam loaded with working loads and standard heating conditions to simulate real-life scenarios. The tested beam failed during the fire, and its fire resistance was recorded. The results demonstrated a good correlation with the experimental results in thermal and structural responses.

Nevertheless, there is no direct comparison between those alternatives to evaluate their contribution to maximizing energy absorption. In this research, three core designs honeycomb, mushroom, and tubular were compared to determine the influence of core shape on the panel’s impact resistance against blast load. In addition to varying core shapes, the effect of plate thickness and the spacing between the core shapes are also examined. Finite element analysis was used to evaluate the performance of these designs. Twenty-seven numerical experiments were performed and then analyzed using regression analysis. Results reveal that the tubular sandwich panel exhibited minimum deformation, and least damage and contributed to the highest kinetic energy dissipation. On the other hand, honeycomb core structures recorded the highest internal energy dissipation, largest deformation, and damage. Despite those differences, core shape and core spacing were not as influential in resisting blast load compared to plate thickness. Facade plate thickness was the most significant factor. Results suggest that more research needs to be targeted toward enhancing façade plate stiffness for better mitigation of blast load."

The research presented in this paper refines the existing FE methodologies for circular, rectangular, elliptical, hexagonal, and octagonal CFDST members under fire conditions. Various modeling parameters, such as thermal properties of different materials and the thermal contact conductance at the interaction surfaces, are incorporated and controlled via an automatic algorithm for proficient modeling. It is found that the available models for calculating the thermal contact conductance at the interfaces between metal tubes and the concrete cores have a strong dependence on the cross-sectional shape. Thus, a refined model of the thermal conductance for the hexagonal and octagonal CFDST columns is proposed. Extensive experimental results (212 fire tests) are assembled from the literature to verify the proposed FE methodology. Good agreements with test results are demonstrated when predicting the temperature fields within the considered CFDST cross-sections. Consequently, extensive results from the proposed algorithm can provide an initial basis for parametric studies and for forthcoming nonlinear stress analysis simulations of CFDST columns under fire, which are primary goals in future studies. Finally, complying with the existing design codes, a new simplified analytical model based on the finite difference (FD) method is presented for predicting the temperature developments through CFDST columns."

The effect of the number of fins, type of PCM, heat flux, PCM volume fraction, and heat sink bottom wall thickness was examined. The results showed that increasing the number of fins improved the performance of the PCM-infused heat sink. When a heat flux of 4000 W/sq m was applied for 30 minutes on a plate fin heat sink infused with paraffin wax, the maximum temperature did not exceed 70°C in the four-fin design, while it exceeded 80°C in the two-fin design. A salt hydrate PCM outperformed paraffin wax and RT35. The bottom wall of the heat sink acted as a thermal spreader and a nonlinear relationship existed between the bottom wall thickness and the maximum electronics temperature. Compared to the two- and four-fin heat sink models, the zero-fin model required the longest time to fully melt the entire PCM due to the additional amount of PCM present in the heat sink gaps."

The tests conducted were compressive tests on hardened mortar cubes (after 3, 7, and 28 days), slump flow, and setting time on fresh mixes. In addition, durability tests of water absorption and rapid chloride penetration were performed on the optimum mix trial. It was observed that increasing the ratio of GGBS to fly ash (60 to 40) significantly increased the compressive strength of concrete. The downside of this mix was its low viscosity which yielded a very stiff mix that failed the slump test. On the other hand, the mix with the ratio of 60% GGBS to 40% fly ash including superplasticizer resulted in an enhancement in both the compressive strength and workability. Finally, the mixes with 40% GGBS to 60% fly ash had a comparatively lower compressive strengths and unacceptable ranges of setting time and slump values. Therefore, based on the results of this research, it is recommended to increase the ratio of GGBS to fly ash in the GPC mix with the addition of a high-performance superplasticizer to maintain the workability, while maintaining the compressive strength of the mortar."

Mechanical properties, such as compressive and tensile strengths, of recycled aggregates concrete (RAC) have been investigated by several researchers and were compared with that of normal aggregate concrete (NAC). In this investigation, the shear strengths and modes of failure of RAC and NAC beams have been investigated. In addition, the behavior of RAC and NAC beams strengthened with carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) U-wrapped laminates have been examined. Four RAC and NAC shear-deficient rectangular beams were cast, two of which were strengthened in shear with CFRP U-wraps. The beams were tested to failure under four-point bending. The test results indicate that the shear capacity of all specimens strengthened with CFRP composites increased significantly compared to the control beam specimens. The performance of the RAC and NAC beams before and after strengthening were compared. It was observed that the RAC specimens provided similar shear strength as that of the NAC beams. The percentage increase in the shear capacity of RAC beams reached almost 60% of the control beam for the beams with U-wraps. The ACI 318-19 and ACI440.2R-17 codes are also used to predict the shear strength of the tested RAC and NAC beams and it was observed that the predicted capacities were close to the experimentally measured ones."

    "abstract": "Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures deteriorate over years due to many reasons including corrosion of reinforcing steel, carbonation of concrete, overload on structural members, among others. This may result in flexural or shear deficiency in RC beams. The failure of shear-deficient RC beams is usually brittle, sudden and with little warning, if any. Diagonal shear cracks will form due to load increase that may result in complete fracture of the RC beam. Therefore, deteriorated and shear-deficient RC beams need to be strengthened to avoid such undesirable shear failure. This paper investigates shear strengthening of RC T-Beams using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates anchored with spike anchors. The beams have been strengthened in flexure to avoid flexural failure and then strengthened in shear using CFRP sheets that were anchored with CFRP spikes. Six beams were strengthened with CFRP laminates at 45<sup>o</sup> and at 90<sup>o</sup> inclination angles and anchored with embedded CFRP spikes with different depths (50 mm and 75 mm) and different diameters (10 mm and 12 mm). Wrapping (U-Wrapped) was also used for anchoring the flexural CFRP laminates. The beams are tested to failure and their capacity were compared with that of an unstrengthen control beam. It is observed that the capacity of the strengthened beams is increased up to 45% compared to that of the control beam. Anchoring with U-wraps enhanced the beam capacity further. The inclination of the CFRP sheets, dowel diameter, and the embedment depth of the spike anchors influenced shear and deformation capacity of the tested RC T-Beams."

A series of four-point loadings tests were conducted on full-scale beams reinforced with Glass FRP (GFRP) bars. The GFRP-UHPC beams were designed as either under-reinforced or over-reinforced to examine the differences in their failure modes. Steel reinforced beams, serving as reference specimens, were also cast and tested. All the beams measured 185 mm in width, 250 mm in depth, and 2200 mm in length. The influence of reinforcement ratio, number of bars, and surface texture of GFRP bars on the flexural behavior was studied. The test results showed that changing the mode of failure from GFRP rupture to concrete crushing improved the ductility flexural capacity of the UHPC beams. It was also shown that the bending stiffnesses, flexural capacities, and strain responses of the UHPC beams were enhanced upon increasing the reinforcement ratio. The experimental data was compared with the ACI 440 and CAN/CSA S806 code provisions. It was found that the recent ACI440 ultimate moment equation provided acceptable results for the under-reinforced beams but was slightly unconservative for the over-reinforced beams. A nonlinear finite element (FE) model was also developed considering both material and geometric nonlinearities using ABAQUS. The developed FE model verified well with the experimental results and can be utilized to simulate different loading scenarios and sections of GFRP UHPC beams."

    "abstract": "Deterioration of infrastructure is a major challenge in the civil engineering industry. One of the methods that has been deemed effective in upgrading reinforced concrete (RC) structures is using externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. However, the efficacy of this retrofitting technique is limited by the premature debonding failure of the FRP at the concrete-FRP interface; thus, the full capacity of the FRP is rarely utilized. Anchorage systems were proposed as a feasible solution to suppress or delay debonding failure. This paper presents an experimental investigation on the use of end U-wraps and carbon FRP (CFRP) spike anchors to anchor CFRP plates bonded to flexure-deficient RC beams. The experimental program consisted of seven RC beams with the length of the CFRP plate, type of anchorage, and the number of anchors as experimental variables. Test results indicated a remarkable enhancement in the ultimate load-carrying capacity when longer CFRP plates were used to strengthen the beams. In addition, anchoring the plates enhanced the strength of the CFRP-plated beams by 16–35% compared to the unanchored specimen, depending on the anchorage type and scheme. Finally, fib Bulletin 90 (2019) provisions provided the most accurate predictions of the moment capacity of the strengthened specimens."

This study investigated the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams transversely reinforced with closed steel cages made by cold-formed WWF sheets.

A comparison between the test results of WWF reinforced beams and their equivalent stirrup reinforced beams were performed. The experimental study was accompanied by a theoretical component utilizing the flexural design provisions in ACI 318 concrete design code. Compared to corresponding beams having stirrups equivalent to the vertical wires of the WWF, the WWF reinforced beams had on average 20% more flexural capacity, just about the same stiffness at service load, and 10% less flexural ductility. The average experimental-to-nominal flexural capacity based on the ACI 318 code of concrete beams enclosed with WWF is equal to 1.15, which indicates that the code can be reliably used to predict the bending moment capacity of such beams. The study recommends always using longitudinal rebars in WWF reinforced beams and not relying solely on the longitudinal wires of the WWF for resisting flexure."

However, more research is still required to determine the suitable quantity of MS and NS in the concrete mix without adversely affecting its strength. Therefore, this research aims at studying the effect of partially replacing cement with MS and NS to enhance the strength and workability of concrete. The influence of different percentages of MS and NS in the concrete mix was investigated. Two types of tests were performed on five concrete mixes to find the optimum concrete mix including slump tests and compressive strength tests. Test results showed that the addition of NS was beneficial in terms of improving the workability of the concrete mix. In fact, the highest enhancement in the slump value was in the mix that had 8% MS and 2% NS with 28% increase compared to the control mix, followed by 9% MS and 1% NS mix with 26% increase. In addition, using 9% of MS and 1% of NS provided the highest enhancement in the compressive strength with 40.7% improvement compared to the control mix.

The widely accepted and reliable analysis platform, OpenSees, requires text-based input (.tcl) files created by a skilled programmer. Hence, a Pre/Post-processing User Interface (UI) software package (INSPECT-SPSW) is introduced herein. With basic input, the INSPECT-SPSW package allows the user to create the OpenSees (.tcl) input file, run different nonlinear analyses, and retrieve and visualize the output. In addition, the UI includes illustrated wrappers for several OpenSees commands for various material definitions, plasticity modeling options, modal analysis, and nonlinear analysis types. Validation and verification were conducted against published results of experimental and numerical cyclic loading specimens. The user-friendly interface successfully created accurate models that capture the SPSW nonlinear behavior, including the various possible failure mechanisms. e.g., beam or column plastic hinging, web plate yielding, etc. With demonstrated performance and intuitive UI, INSPECT-SPSW is expected to facilitate the broad adoption of the strip method for Performance-Based Earthquake Design (PBED) of SPSWs."

    "title": "Effect of flange geometry on the shear capacity of RC T-beams — Jamal A. Abdalla, Rami A. Hawileh",
    "abstract": "In reinforced concrete (RC) beams, shear failure is sudden and brittle without prior indication of failure. As a result, extensive research has been conducted over the past century to develop design equations and models that combine the variables contributing to the shear resistance in RC members. Despite that, this essential phenomenon is still the least understood problem in reinforced concrete. In most current design codes, the nominal shear capacity of RC beams comes from superposition of concrete and steel reinforcement. The contribution of concrete in slender beams comes from three sources: shear resisted by concrete in the uncracked compression zone, shear transfer by aggregate interlocking at the edge of the diagonal crack, and dowel action from the longitudinal reinforcement. In most shear design equations, the shear is assumed to be resisted only by the web of the beams by aggregate interlock at the shear crack. The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-sections is usually ignored in the shear strength models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear capacity of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate and compare the shear capacity of RC T-beams using shear strength models available in the design guidelines and the literature. Some of the chosen design models included the flange contribution to the shear capacity, while other models neglected this phenomenon. The models were evaluated against an experimental data base that included slender RC T-beams with different geometry, flexural and shear reinforcement ratios, compressive strength of concrete, and shear span-to-depth ratios. In addition, the effect of the ratio of flange width to the web width and flange thickness to the total height of the member on the shear capacity of the T-beams were assessed. The analytical results showed that the shear capacity is underestimated by most of the current shear strength models. However, the models that were developed in the recent literature to include flange geometry resulted in safe and accurate predictions of the shear capacity of RC T-beams. As a result, it is recommended that the effect of flange is included in the design equations to aid in a more economical design that is consistent with the true capacity of the member."

The model incorporates temperature-dependent thermal and mechanical properties of concrete, steel reinforcement, and CFRP, as well as mechanical bond interaction between CFRP and concrete interfaces. The predicted temperature profiles, ultimate loads, and midspan deflections are compared with previously published experimental data.

For this research, two cohesionless soil types were investigated and treated with quicklime: poorly graded and well-graded cohesionless soils. For poorly graded soil, the lime percentage varied from 0.0% to 6.0% based on the soil’s weight, while for well-graded soil, it ranged from 0.0% to 3.0%. All the soil specimens were cured for 24 h and tested using the hole erosion test (HET) to replicate the internal erosion effortlessly. The analyzed results demonstrated the efficiency of quicklime as an internal erosion stabilizer for cohesionless soils. The optimum lime content for poorly graded cohesionless soils was 5.0%; for well-graded, the percentage was approximately 3.0%. Moreover, adding lime significantly improved the strength, critical shear stress, and erosion rate index of the soil."

This study investigates the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) and GSM sheets under harsh climatic conditions of saline water and direct sunlight. The main focus was to recommend two important reduction factors, the bond reduction factor and the overall flexural reduction actor, when concrete beams are subjected to two said environments for a long period. These factors were compared to the ones recommended by different codes. The CFRP sheets were attached to the beams’ soffit with epoxy adhesive, whereas the GSM sheets were bonded either with epoxy (SME) or epoxy-based mortar (SMM). The specimens were weathered under saline water and direct sunlight for a period of 6, 12, and 24 months. The load-carrying capacity of CFRP, SMM, and SME strengthened specimens increased by 47%, 55%, and 55%, respectively, when compared to the unstrengthened specimens at 28 days. The bond capacity reduction factors (R<inf>b</inf>) for CFRP, SMM, and SME strengthening systems were 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 for saline water exposure, and 0.95, 0.85, and 0.85 for sun exposure, respectively, over a period of two years. On the other hand, the recommended overall flexure strength reduction factors (R<inf>n</inf>) for CFRP, SMM, and SME strengthening systems were 0.85, 0.85, and 0.90 for saline water exposure, and 0.95, 0.90, and 0.90 for sun exposure, respectively.

The variations in flexural strength, compressive strength, and density were then tested according to ASTM standards. Findings from this investigation indicate that the degradation in the mechanical strength of concrete does not seem to be significantly affected by the increase in the percentage of recycled aggregates. However, a significant and linear decrease in the density was observed at 400°C with an increase in the percentage of recycled aggregates. The degradation of the compressive and flexural strengths of recycled aggregate concrete with increasing temperatures obtained from the experimental analysis was compared with the analytical predictions provided by Eurocode 2. Moreover, simplified equations have been proposed to estimate the degradation of the mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete at higher temperatures. The incorporation of recycled aggregates into concrete resulted in satisfactory residual performance."

    "abstract": "Openings in the shear span can significantly affect the structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams, particularly in terms of shear capacity and crack propagation. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of strengthening the web opening in the shear zone of RC beams by using iron-based shape memory alloy (Fe-SMA) bars, providing valuable insights for structural engineers and researchers. Numerical analysis with ABAQUS/CAE 2020 software was employed in the current study. The research was divided into six groups of beams with web openings of different lengths (150, 300, and 450 mm), prestressing levels (0%, 30%, and 60%), and reinforcement diameters (14, 18, and 22 mm) of Fe-SMA bars. The results show that the presence of web openings can cause a significant reduction in the cracking and ultimate loads of the beams, with reductions ranging from 11% to 50% and 36% to 48%, respectively. However, by adding pre-stressed Fe-SMA bars around small web openings (100 × 150 mm), the shear capacity of the beam is restored, and the beam exhibits behavior similar to solid beams. Additionally, activating the Fe-SMA bars by 30% and 60% resulted in almost similar cracking loads but improved load-carrying capacity of the beam with small openings by 12% and 9%, respectively, compared to the solid beam. The technique proposed for enhancing shear strength is most effective for beams with small (100 × 150 mm) and medium (100 × 300 mm) web openings as it can restore both the beam’s shear strength and stiffness. However, for beams with larger web openings (100 × 450 mm), the use of activated Fe-SMA beams can recover almost 90% of the solid beam’s shear capacity. Furthermore, reinforcing small openings with Fe-SMA bars of different diameters enhances beam shear capacity and stiffness, while for larger openings, higher Fe-SMA reinforcement ratios could potentially restore the beam’s full strength and stiffness. This study emphasizes the importance of strengthening web openings in RC beams, particularly in shear zones, and provides significant insights into how to strengthen beams with web openings, thereby contributing to developing safer structures. However, further laboratory experiments are recommended to validate, complement and extend the findings of this numerical study."

The NHERI-SimCenter application framework provides generic solutions implemented in different hazard simulation problems. Seismic isolation is an efficient, proven technique for improving seismic performance by limiting drift ratios and reducing damage. During the design stage, seismic isolation-system parameters must be carefully calibrated to control different aspects of the response, and it is necessary to run multiple simulations and count for parameter uncertainties.

The developed ULW-ECCs has a density less than 1500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, compressive strength of 75 MPa and tensile strain capacity greater than 8%. The electromechanical properties of the ULW-ECCs were evaluated under cyclic and monotonic loading. The evaluation criteria included compression, tension, and flexure. Self-sensing of flexural damage in ULW-ECCs beams was verified by measuring the volume and surface impedance. In addition, the polarization effect and electrical conductivity stability (under different temperatures, water contents of the matrix, and testing methods) were examined. The experimental results revealed that: the mechanical properties of the ULW-ECCs can be increased without sacrificing workability by incorporating CPC. ULW-ECCs incorporating CPC show excellent self-sensing properties and weaken the polarization effect. A large gauge factor (>1000), high signal-to-noise ratio, repeatability, and high sensitivity can be achieved. The electrical conductivity stability of the ULW-ECC under different environments can be noticeably improved with sufficient CPC. Furthermore, the microstructure of the new ULW-ECCs was observed by SEM to further explain the results.

    "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are widely used in the strengthening and retrofitting of reinforced concrete (RC) members to enhance their flexural and shear capacities. Strengthening with FRP systems has been proven effective due to their superior properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. However, the debonding of FRP laminates from the concrete substrate is a major concern as it results in a brittle member failure. Anchorage systems could delay early debonding of the FRP laminates and improve the FRP-to-concrete bond. Carbon FRP (CFRP) spike anchors are commonly used as anchorage systems due to their compatibility with CFRP laminates and versatility to suit a varied range of applications. However, research to study the effects of different anchor parameters on strength enhancement has been limited. Hence, this study investigated the effect of CFRP anchor diameter, embedment depth, and dowel angle on the capacity of concrete beams strengthened with externally bonded CFRP laminates. All beams were tested using the four-point bending flexural test. Test results of anchored strengthened beams showed an increase in load-carrying capacity and CFRP strain utilization of up to 50% and 84%, respectively, when compared to the unanchored strengthened beams. In addition, larger embedment depth and insertion angle showed a significant effect on the capacity of the specimens. Finally, anchoring CFRP laminates with different anchor parameters delayed debonding failure with different anchor failure modes. Increasing the anchor diameter up to 12 mm prevented anchor rupture. Furthermore, increasing the embedment depth increased the beam capacity but resulted in anchor rupture. Anchoring CFRP laminates at large angles shifted the anchor rupture failure to partial anchor pullout. This study demonstrates that CFRP spike anchors, when properly designed and installed, can delay the brittle debonding failure mode, thus enhancing the load-carrying capacity of strengthened members."

In this study, experimental tests were performed on concrete cylinders confined with FRCM systems that consisted of mineral mortar and poliparafenilenbenzobisoxazole fabric (PBO). The cylinders with concrete strengths of 30, 45, and 70 MPa, were confined with one or two FRCM layers, and were subjected to different target temperatures (100, 400, and 800 °C).

Similarly, the noncorroding fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars have demonstrated reliable structural performance at a competitive price. The combination of these materials substantially improves the service lifespan for reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Earlier research investigations and existing standards do not account for FRP reinforcement in the design for compressive forces. This study revisits this design approach while experimentally investigating the axial compressive behavior of slender circular GGBS-based green concrete columns reinforced with double layers of steel and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars and spirals. The experimental program consists of nine large-scale specimens loaded concentrically. All specimens had a diameter of 260 mm and a length of 2,500 mm, yielding a slenderness ratio of 38.5. Two control specimens were reinforced with a single steel layer having 1.2% and 2.5% longitudinal reinforcement ratios. The remaining seven specimens had an outer layer of GFRP reinforcement and an inner layer of steel reinforcement. The investigated parameters were: (1) longitudinal reinforcement ratio; (2) spiral reinforcement ratio; and (3) spiral reinforcement configuration (pitch and diameter). The experimental findings revealed that all tested columns failed in a material-type failure. However, the slenderness effects reduced the strength of the hybrid-reinforced columns compared with the control counterparts. The steel-reinforced control specimens demonstrated load-carrying capacities that agreed well with nominal capacity predictions under existing code. Conversely, the nominal capacity predictions in current codes and standards underestimated the strength of the hybrid specimens. A proposed equation from the literature that considers the compression contribution of GFRP bars was also evaluated, and a proposed correction factor was introduced to count for second-order effects. Due to the limited number of specimens in this study, future research is warranted to refine this proposed correction factor further."

    "abstract": "Advanced composite materials in the form of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) have been gaining popularity in the construction industry. One of the main challenges of using externally bonded FRP in repair and strengthening applications is its susceptibility to peeling-off or delamination without achieving the full capacity of the FRP material. Anchoring the FRP laminates has been deemed effective in delaying debonding failure, thus ensuring load continuity between the concrete and FRP. This paper aims to study the effect of two anchorage systems on the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with carbon FRP (CFRP) laminates. The anchors considered in this study were end U-wraps and CFRP spike anchors. A total of seven RC beams were cast and strengthened with different arrangements of CFRP laminates and anchors. The test parameters investigated in this study include the length of the FRP sheet, type of anchor, and the number of CFRP spike anchors. Test results showed that flexural strengthening using CFRP laminates enhanced the capacity of the unstrengthened beam by 16–41% at the expense of ductility. Using full-length CFRP sheets significantly improved the overall performance of the beams as opposed to short-length CFRP sheets. Out of the anchored specimens, the best improvement in the capacity was achieved in the specimen anchored with end U-wraps. CFRP spike anchors provided limited enhancement in the load-carrying capacity of the specimens. The efficiency of the spike anchors could be upgraded if longer embedment depth and larger dowel diameter were used. Finally, the ACI440.2R-17 strength predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results."

This paper presents the results of an experimental study that aims to investigate the mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) bars subjected to compressive loads at various elevated temperatures and deformation rates. Four different temperatures, ranging between ambient and 150°C, and two deformation rates were considered. The compressive strength and the modulus of elasticity for each bar sample are measured and the failure modes are demonstrated. It was observed that the compressive strength of GFRP bars is similar under both loading rates for all temperature conditions. However, the elastic modulus of the bars showed a slight discrepancy between the different load rates, especially at an elevated temperature of 150°C. The test results indicate a linear degradation in the mechanical properties as the temperature is raised. In addition, the observed failure mode for the tested samples is splitting of the bars."

    "abstract": "Because of the global warming issue, stakeholders in the construction sector are searching for a suitable alternative to traditional concrete owing to its undesired properties like thermal conductivity and high dead load. ‎The emerging trend is the adoption of ‎foamed concrete (FC) because it has a high ‎strength ‎compared to its lightweight and low density, which varies between 300 and 1800 ‎kg/m<sup>3</sup>. These properties reduce the overall production cost, including ‎transportation and ‎labor costs. Moreover, the high porosity of FC significantly decreases the ‎thermal insulation, ‎producing a suitable ‎structure ‎for different weathering ‎conditions‎. This paper reviews the properties and ‎applications of eco-friendly FC, discussing its components as well as waste materials; different ‎fresh properties, such as stability and workability; and hardened properties, such as ‎compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths. Furthermore, practical features such as durability, fire resistance, ‎thermal conductivity, microstructure, and sustainability of FC are explored to better appreciate the mutable features that support a superior comfortable atmosphere for whole climatic situations. This review concludes by shedding light on some future ‎recommendations to encourage the applications of waste materials in FC in different ‎construction fields.‎"

    "abstract": "The adoption of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars in concrete structures has increased due to their superior mechanical properties and durability. However, the compressive response of FRP bars at high temperatures remains unclear. This article presents an experimental study on the behavior of glass FRP (GFRP) and basalt FRP (BFRP) bars subjected to compressive loads at different elevated temperatures and deformation rates. The study considers four different temperature conditions: ambient temperature (25 °C), 50 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C, and two different deformation rates: 0.5 mm/min and 1000 mm/min. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to accurately measure strains at high temperatures by generating a suitable speckle pattern over the specimen surface for full-field deformation measurements. The study results revealed that the modulus of elasticity and compressive strength of both GFRP and BFRP bars degraded as the temperature increased from 25 °C to 150 °C. The compressive strength reduction was higher at 150 °C compared to 100 °C, and the reduction was more significant for BFRP bars than GFRP bars. The compressive strength of GFRP bars was comparable under both strain rates for all temperature conditions. However, the elastic modulus of the bars showed a slight variation between the different load rates, especially at an elevated temperature of 150 °C. For the BFRP bars, the study found that different strain rates at ambient temperature resulted in significant deviation in the compressive strength and modulus of elasticity results. At higher temperatures, the reduction in mechanical properties was more pronounced. In summary, the study provides valuable insights into the behavior of GFRP and BFRP bars under compressive loads at elevated temperatures, which is useful for designing and assessing the performance of FRP-reinforced structures under fire conditions."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for fiber reinforced lightweight concrete (FLWC) has increased rapidly to make high-strength, durable and lightweight structures. The strengthening behaviour of FLWC has never been studied in the literature and currently there are no standard guidelines for strengthened FLWC beams. Therefore, the main aim and objective of the current experimental study is to investigate the shear behaviour of fiber reinforced lightweight self-compacting concrete (FLWSCC) beams externally strengthened with CFRP strips. Six full-scale reinforced concrete (RC) beams were tested under four-point bending with varying CFRP strip spacing, number of layers, and configuration. One additional beam served as the control specimen to compare the performance of the strengthened specimens. The experimental results indicated that the external CFRP strips enhanced the strength and stiffness of the strengthened FLWSCC specimens. The strength enhancement ranged from 12% to 91% and pull out of steel fiber and debonding of CFRP strips was the predominant mode of failure in the control and strengthened specimens. The presence of steel fibers in the concrete has increased the shear strength of concrete and limits the external contribution of CFRP strips. Furthermore, all the experimental results were compared with theoretically predicted shear capacities using various FRP design standards for external strengthening. All the design standards have overestimated the shear capacity of FLWSCC specimens and CNR-DT (2013) design standard was found to be the most conservative as compared to other design standards. In addition, a lightweight modification factor has been recommended for strengthened FLWSCC beams"

Results showed that the fire resistance of the walls was highly compromised under hydrocarbon fire. In addition, the minimum wall thickness specified by EC2 may not be sufficient to achieve the desired fire resistance under considered fire scenarios.

The study contributed to the current state-of-the-art research on the behaviour of RC walls of different concrete types exposed to fire loading, and it also identified the factors affecting the fire resistance of RC walls.

An experimental study performed on eight full-scale shear deficient beam specimens. One beam served as the reference specimen and remaining beam specimens were internally reinforced with impregnated CFRP laminate stirrups. The parameters investigated in this study were the stirrup configuration, number of layers, stirrup spacing and width. Specimen tested under two-point loading and all results in term of load-deflection response as well as their failure modes were reported. All tested specimens failed due to shear compression failure mode along with the rupture of CFRP laminate stirrups, and the inclusion of CFRP laminate stirrups has significantly enhanced the nominal capacity of LWSCC beams ranged from 91%− 200% over control specimen. Shear strengths of the tested specimens were also theoretically predicted using different design standards. Comparison between the experimental and predicted shear strength has shown that ACI 440.1R-15, CSA S806–12, and CSA S6–14 provided the closest prediction. Therefore, it has been concluded that CFRP laminate stirrups can be used as a transverse reinforcement in GFRP reinforced LWSCC beams."

    "abstract": "Recently, the design of scaffolding systems has garnered considerable attention due to the increasing number of scaffold collapses. These incidents arise from the underestimation of imposed loads and the site-specific conditions that restrict the application of lateral restraints in scaffold assemblies. The present study is committed to augmenting the buckling resistance of vertical support members, obviating the need for supplementary lateral restraints. To achieve this objective, experimental and computational analyses were performed to assess the axial load buckling capacity of steel props, composed of two hollow steel pipes that slide into each other for a certain length. Three full-scale steel props with various geometric properties were tested to construct and validate the analytical models. The total unsupported length of the steel props is 6 m, while three pins were installed to tighten the outer and inner pipes in the distance they overlapped. Finite Element (FE) modeling is carried out for the three steel props, and the developed models were verified using the experimental results. Also, theoretical analysis is utilized to verify the FE analysis. Using the FE-verified models, a parametric study is conducted to evaluate the effect of different inserted pipe lengths on the steel props' axial load capacity and lateral displacement. Based on the results, the typical failure mode for the studied steel props is global elastic buckling. Also, the prop's elastic buckling strength is sensitive to the inserted length of the smaller pipe. A threshold of minimum inserted length is one-third of the total length, after which the buckling strength increases. The present study offers a prop with enhanced buckling resistance and introduces an equation for calculating an equivalent effective length factor (k), which can be seamlessly incorporated into Euler's buckling equation, thereby facilitating the determination of the buckling capacity of the enhanced props and providing a pragmatic engineering solution."

However, the limitations of using epoxy resin only at low temperature below the glass transition temperature, has created a need to replace the epoxy adhesives with cementitious bonding materials to provide better resistance at high temperatures environments. This program assessed the bonding between near-surface mounted (NSM) carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) Laminate and concrete using modified cement-based adhesive at site exposure in high temperature environment.

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are widely used to strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Its major drawback is the brittle failure mode in the form of debonding of the CFRP laminate. The use of CFRP spike anchors demonstrated positive outcomes in mitigating the debonding failure in small-scale concrete prisms in previous studies. However, the real-life behavior of anchored RC beams was rarely studied. This study aims to investigate the flexural behavior of externally strengthened RC beams with CFRP laminates and anchored at end with CFRP spike anchors. The results of anchored beams was compared with unanchored specimens in terms of load-deflection response, strain in the FRP laminates, and failure modes. Results showed that anchorage of CFRP laminates with CFRP splay anchors positively affected the flexural capacity of the specimens. An average increase in the load-carrying capacity of 19 % was portrayed in the anchored specimens compared to the unanchored specimen. Anchorage of FRP laminates resulted in the mitigation of debonding failure and thus, enhanced strain utilization in laminates. A considerable improvement in strain utilization is exhibited by the specimen anchored with two anchors at each end. Moreover, increasing the anchor's dowel diameter significantly improved the load-carrying capacity but lowered the ultimate strain reached in the laminate. Results indicated that larger diameter anchors provide strengthening effect similar to increasing the number of FRP layers instead of providing anchorage to the FRP sheet. This is primarily due to the increase in the fan length and thickness as the anchor's dowel diameter increases."

The numerical model is calibrated using a ¼ scale experimental test and then applied to study the lateral earth pressure response of full-scale nonyielding walls with a height of 4 m. Realistic material properties, measurable in the laboratory, are employed in the simulations to capture significant effects on wall behavior. The backfill soil is modeled as a cohesionless material with elastic–plastic response and the Mohr–Coulomb (M–C) failure criterion. The results highlight the effect of increasing the soil’s friction angle on the reduction of the induced lateral forces, and hence the wall’s lateral deflection. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the resultant lateral earth force measured position, in comparison to the conventionally employed design methodologies. Finally, the study examines the effect of the variations of the soil–wall interface friction angle and wall concrete elastic modulus on the wall's lateral deflection and the locations of resultant lateral earth forces."

    "abstract": "Cement has historically been a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, and substituting cement in concrete with alternative cementitious materials will lead to a decrease in carbon footprints. A vast amount of literature focuses on the mechanical properties and performance of concrete partially replaced with different cementitious materials. However, the literature on the structural performance of concrete with different cementitious materials is very limited. Therefore, the main aim of the current experimental study is to evaluate the flexural and shear performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams cast with various replacement percentages of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash. A total of 33 RC beams were cast with 50% and 70% replacement of cement with GGBS and fly ash. In addition, the tensile and compressive strengths of the different mixes with GGBS and fly ash were also compared with the 100% OPC mix at 28 and 56 days. All beams were subjected to monotonic four-point bending tests and load-deflection response curves along with failure modes were presented. The experimental results showed that the average compressive and tensile strength of mixes with GGBS and fly ash replacement were comparable with OPC. The mixes with 50% replacement and higher usage of GGBS showed higher compressive strengths compared to mixes with 70% replacement. In addition, the flexural performance of beams with GGBS and fly ash were comparable to the specimen with 100% OPC. Even GGBS and fly ash replacement increased the stiffness and yield strength of the beam specimens by 36 and 16% compared to the control specimen. The specimens tested at 56 days with higher usage of fly ash and 50% replacement showed the highest flexural load as compared with other specimens. In the case of the shear specimens, the normalized ultimate shear capacity of RC beams is not significantly affected when OPC is replaced with 50% and 70% of GGBS and fly ash, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the overall behavior of SCM beams was comparable to that of the control OPC beams. The ACI 318-19 design guidelines were also used to predict the flexural and shear capacity of RC beams cast with GGBS and fly ash. The aforementioned experiments indicate the viability and effectiveness of cement replacements in concrete with SCM, which in return, contribute to lower carbon footprints."

Beams strengthened with FRP sheets exhibit improved performance in terms of flexural capacity. However, the ductility of the beams is sacrificed due to the brittle failure of externally bonded FRP sheets in the form of FRP debonding or concrete cover delamination. Spike anchorage systems were developed to prevent or mitigate debonding of FRP sheets in externally strengthened RC beams. This study aims to investigate the effect of increasing the number of FRP spike anchors at the laminate's ends on the flexural behavior of strengthened and anchored RC beams. Three concrete beams having a length, depth, and width of 2000, 250, 200 mm, respectively, were tested under a four-point bending test. The first beam was strengthened and unanchored, and the other two beams were strengthened and anchored with one or two 14-mm diameter FRP anchors on each side, respectively. Results showed that increasing the number of anchors significantly improved the flexural behavior of the strengthened beam in terms of the beam's response at failure and the strain utilized in the FRP laminates. The strain utilization percentages as reported in the tested beams were 27%, 61%, and 99%, for the control unanchored, anchored with two anchors, and anchored with four anchors, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that anchoring FRP sheets with two anchors at the laminate's ends if feasible is more effective than one anchor in delaying debonding failure, and thus would lead to a better enhancement in the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams."

In addition, one RAC specimen was left unstrengthened to act as a benchmark specimen. For comparison purposes, an additional five normal aggregate concrete (NAC) beams were cast, three of which are strengthened with similar CFRP schemes as that of the RAC, and one was left unstrengthened. All beams are loaded under four-point bending tests, and the results in terms of shear force-deflection graphs and failure modes are analyzed and compared. Experimental results indicated that the shear force values obtained in NAC and RAC beams are comparable. In fact, the percentage increase in the shear strength compared to the respective control beam was higher for RAC beams than that of NAC beams. This proves the effectiveness of using different shear strengthening configurations and the viability of using CFRP shear strengthened RAC beams compared to CFRP shear strengthened NAC beams."

However, FRP bar exposure for an extended period of time to harsh environmental conditions and chemicals can have an adverse effect on their mechanical properties. In this investigation, glass FRP bars were exposed to indoor controlled temperature, outdoor direct sunlight, outdoor shade, seawater, and alkaline solution for six months prior to using them as reinforcement in concrete flexural members. This research involves the fabrication and testing of five pairs of 3 m-long concrete beams with 200 mm by 300 mm cross-sections embedded in the tension zone with the exposed GFRP bars. The 10 beams were instrumented with strain gauges and tested following a four-point loading scheme using a hydraulic jack attached to a rigid steel frame. Crack width records from the tests showed the inferior serviceability of the beams that contained rebars stored in an outdoor environment relative to the control beams. GFRP bar exposure to an alkaline solution or outdoor direct sunlight slightly affected the cracking and ultimate moment capacities, reducing them by 5% and 3% in terms of the same parameters as the controlled indoor exposure, respectively. The influence of GFRP bar exposure to open-air shade or sunlight decreased the pre-cracking stiffness by 25% and flexural ductility by 10–20% when compared with the control specimens. The predicted ultimate flexural strength using the ACI 440 provisions gave comparable results to the experimentally obtained values. A simple mathematical equation that envelops the moment–deflection relationship for GFRP over-reinforced concrete beams and only requires information about initial cracking and ultimate flexural conditions is proposed."

Although geotechnical engineers design foundations for layered soil, majorly current geotechnical studies emphasize single homogenous soil. So, this research has significant novelty as it focuses on layered soil and adds to the current literature. A nonlinear FE model was prepared and analyzed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of two-layered soil (sandy soil over clayey soil). The Drucker–Prager and Mohr–Coulomb models were used to represent sandy soil and clayey soil layers, respectively. Strip footing material properties were considered isotropic and linearly elastic. This study performed parametric studies to understand the effects of thickness, unit weight, and the modulus of the elasticity of sandy soil on the ultimate soil bearing capacity. Additionally, it also analyzed the effect of the cohesive strength of clayey soil on layered soil bearing capacity. Results showed that an increase in sandy soil layer thickness strengthens the layered soil, and thus, improves the bearing capacity of soil. Increasing the sandy soil layer thickness over footing width (h1/B) ratio from 0.15 to 2.0 improved the ultimate bearing capacities with elastic settlements of 350 mm and 250 mm by 145.62% and 101.66%, respectively. Additionally, for a thicker sandy soil layer, an increase in the unit weight and modulus of the elasticity of sandy soil led to higher ultimate bearing capacity. Furthermore, it was concluded that an increase in clayey soil’s cohesive strength from 20 kPa to 30 kPa resulted in a 24.31% and 3.47% increase in soil bearing capacity for h1/B = 0.15 and h1/B = 2.0, respectively.

    "abstract": "The adoption of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars in lieu of traditional steel reinforcement for concrete structures has gained prominence. Nevertheless, prevailing international standards have not incorporated provisions to assess the significant contribution of FRP materials to the axial capacity and deformability of compression members. This study investigates the impact of Basalt (BFRP) ties on the axial performance of full-scale concrete columns reinforced with BFRP and Glass (GFRP) rebars, alongside traditional steel longitudinal rebars. Ten columns were subjected to concentric loading, with parameters including the type of longitudinal rebars (BFRP, GFRP, and steel), spacing of BFRP ties (180 mm, 120 mm, and 60 mm), and diameter of steel rebars (16 mm and 20 mm). Varied steel rebar diameters aimed to discern the influence of axial stiffness on column behavior. Results indicate an 18 % to 26 % higher axial load capacity in steel-reinforced concrete (RC) columns compared to FRP-RC columns. Both types of FRP rebars contributed approximately 12 % to the axial capacity. Reducing BFRP tie spacing from 180 mm to 60 mm significantly increased deformability by up to 250 % in FRP-RC columns and ductility by up to 14 % in steel-RC columns. The study highlights conservative predictions in existing design equations (ACI 440.11–22 and CSA S806-12) for the axial load capacity of BFRP and GFRP RC columns, underestimating by 14 % to 20 %, as they neglect the contribution of FRP rebars. Utilizing a concrete crushing strain of 3,000 µε and 3,500 µε as the ultimate FRP compressive strain produced predictions closest to the experimental axial load capacity."

This study developed thermoelectric ultra-lightweight engineered cementitious composites (ULW-ECC) with low thermal conductivity (0.478 – 0.668 W/(mK)) and low density (1003 – 1157 kg/m<sup>3</sup>). Carbon fibre (CF) of varying lengths (1 – 20 mm) and concentrations (0, 0.5, and 1.0 vol%) were incorporated, and the mechanical, electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance of the composite were thoroughly examined. Additionally, the impact of saturation and drying treatment on thermoelectric conversion efficiency was assessed. The results revealed that the inclusion of mineral admixtures and fly ash cenospheres within the composite could decrease the content of OH<sup>–</sup> ions in pore solution due to the pozzolanic effect. This phenomenon led to the creation of a high-performance p-type ionic thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 3.14 mV/℃. Moreover, treatments involving saturation and drying were found to respectively enhance and diminish conversion efficiency. Incorporating CF into ULW-ECC generates an ionic-electronic thermoelectric effect through the collaborative interaction of metal cations and positive hole carriers from both the pore solution and CF, respectively. Thermoelectric conversion efficiency varied with CF length and dosage, with a peak improvement in the Seebeck coefficient reaching 5.9 mV/℃. However, a sharp decline occurred when a continuous conductive network was formed."

    "title": "Resistance Factor Spectra for the Ultimate Limit State of the National Building Code of Canada — Sami W. Tabsh",
    "abstract": "Over the years, structural engineering codes and specifications in Canada and elsewhere have moved from an allowable stress design (ASD) approach to a load and resistance factor design (LRFD) philosophy. LRFD methodology takes better account of the inherent variability in both loading and resistance by providing different factors of safety for loads of distinct natures with regard to their probability of overload, frequency of occurrences and changes in point of application. The method also results in safer structures because it considers the behavior at collapse. While resistance factors for traditional construction materials based on LRFD in the National Building Code (NBC) of Canada are available, they cannot be used for non-conventional ones. This is because the resistance of such materials due to various load effects has unique bias factors (λ<inf>R</inf>) and coefficients of variation (V<inf>R</inf>), which greatly impact their reliability index (β). In this study, relationships between the resistance factor ϕ and critical load effects from the NBC load combinations at ultimate limit states are developed for a wide range of resistance bias factors and coefficients of variation. The relationships are presented in the form of charts that are useful for researchers and code-writing professionals who have expertise in the various fields of structural engineering but lack proper background in reliability theory. The developed spectra showed that for the same ϕ, β increases with an increase in the live-to-dead load (L/D) ratio until it reaches 1; thereafter, the shape of the relationship will depend on the statistics of the resistance as well as on the magnitude of ϕ. For a small ϕ and V<inf>R</inf>, β will keep increasing with an increase in the L/D ratio from 1 until 3, albeit at a lesser rate. For L/D > 3, the relationship between the critical β and applied load is just about constant. This finding is also true for load combinations involving snow and wind. Application of the method is illustrated by a practical example involving the shear strength of a corrugated web steel beam."

Notched prisms strengthened using low-cord density steel mesh (LSM) with epoxy (SME-strengthened) and cement mortar (SMM-strengthened), and CFRP-epoxy systems were weathered under saline water and direct sunlight for a period of 28 and 540 days. The results of the study were analyzed based on experimentally obtained ultimate load (P<inf>u</inf>) values and empirically calculated average bond shear stress (τ<inf>avg</inf>) and prism strength retention (R<inf>p</inf>) values. The bond strength degraded by 39 and 34 % in CFRP strengthened, 2.9 and 33 % in SME strengthened, and 2.8 and 10.8 % in SMM-strengthened specimens following the 540-day exposure to saline water and direct sunlight, respectively. The average prism retention ratio was calculated to be 0.61 and 0.66 for CFRP-strengthened, 0.97 and 0.67 for SME-strengthened, and 0.97 and 0.89 for SMM-strengthened specimens after 540 days of saline water and direct sunlight exposure.

Saline water exposure was observed to be most critical to all strengthening systems. Although CFRP-strengthened specimens showed minimum degradation in load-carrying capacity under both conditioning regimes, they showed maximum bond strength reduction in contrast to SMM-strengthened specimens. It was observed that the choice of bonding agent significantly influenced the extent of bond strength degradation under extreme exposure regimes, like those that prevail in the UAE and the Persian Gulf."

This experimental investigation is aimed at studying and comparing the efficacy of bottom- and side-bonded CFRP sheets for flexural strengthening of RC beams with variable internal steel ratios. The effect of steel reinforcement ratio, and the number of CFRP plies are examined by testing 10 RC beams under a four-point bending configuration. The results in terms of load-deflection response, ultimate load-carrying capacity, failure modes, and ductility are studied and compared with control unstrengthened beams. The study revealed that side-bonded beams provided flexural capacity comparable to the bottom-bonded beams for both ratios of internal reinforcement used in the study. The study also showed that both strengthening configurations were more effective when the internal steel ratio was low. In terms of ductility, the side-bonded scheme provided ductility indices comparable to the bottom-bonded beams.

    "abstract": "This study explores technological advancements enabling the utilization of GFRP bars in concrete structures, particularly in coastal areas. However, GFRP bars often encounter reduced bend strength at specific bend locations, which may pose a challenge in their practical application. Various properties such as the strength of bent GFRP bars are crucial for quality assurance, yet existing testing methods stated in ASTM D7914M-21 and ACI 440.3R-15 have limitations when applied to different GFRP bent shapes. Furthermore, those methods require special precautions to ensure symmetry and avoid eccentricities in specimens. To address these challenges, CSA S807:19 introduced a simpler standardized testing procedure that involves embedding a single L-shaped GFRP stirrup in a concrete block. However, the specified large block size in CSA S807:19 Annex E may pose difficulties for both laboratory and on-site quality control tests. Therefore, CSA S807:19 Annex E (Clause 7.1.2b) permits the use of a customized block size, as long as it meets the bend strength of the FRP bars without causing concrete splitting. To date, very few prior research has explored the use of custom block sizes. Therefore, this study aims to thoroughly investigate the strength of bent FRP bars with custom block sizes and without block confinement. Such an investigation serves to highlight the user-friendliness and efficiency of the CSA S807:19 Annex E method. The study recommends two block sizes: 200x400x300 mm (7.87x15.75x11.81 in) for bars <16 mm (0.63 in) diameter and 200x200x300 mm (7.87x7.87x11.81 in) for bars <12 mm (0.39 in). Additionally, the study cautions against using confinement reinforcement, especially with smaller blocks, as it could interfere with the embedded bent FRP bar. Furthermore, the study suggests incorporating additional tail length to mitigate the debonding effects resulting from fixing the strain gauges to the bent portion of the embedded FRP bar. By exploring these modifications, the study seeks to enhance the effectiveness of the testing procedure and expand its practical application for both laboratory and on-site quality assurance. The findings hold implications for the reliable testing of GFRP bars' strength, advancing their use as reinforcement in concrete structures."

The study measured the ultimate load, extension, and strain values, and subsequently calculated the bond stress and slip. It was observed that the ultimate load, bond stress, and failure modes exhibited variations depending on the concrete strength and bond length. For a concrete strength of 60 MPa and a bonded length of 80 % of the concrete prism length, the ultimate load and maximum bond stress increased by 54.0 % and 66.0 % respectively, compared to those with a concrete strength of 20 MPa and the same bonded length. Additionally, when comparing a bonded length of 80 % (200 mm) of the concrete prism length to a bonded length of 20 % (50 mm), the ultimate load and maximum bond stress increased by 20.0 % and 99.0 % respectively for a concrete strength of 60 MPa. The study also developed bond stress-slip models for the AA-concrete interface, as well as models for predicting the ultimate load based on concrete strength and bonded length.

Experimental studies were conducted on RC beams with different strengthening configurations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening method. In addition, analysis on the working mechanism and a parametric analysis were performed for the composite strengthened beam using nonlinear finite element modeling. The experimental results showed that FGRE composite layers can significantly improve the bearing capacity of RC beams.

The ECC grout layer maintained a good bonding performance with the concrete substrate until beam failure. The flexural capacity of RC beams with the proposed FGRE strengthening systems is determined by the thickness of the ECC layer. In addition, the effect of strengthening on the flexural capacity was more significant when the yield and tensile strength of the steel reinforcement were lower. Moreover, the prediction deviation from the experimental data of the FE models and analytical models for the ultimate load-bearing capacity were less than 2 and 7 %, respectively.

Test results highlighted the effectiveness of PBO-FRCM in insulating the column, with the strengthened column showing a substantial 31.9% reduction in temperature readings at the concrete surface compared to its unstrengthened counterpart. Furthermore, the presence of Sikacrete 213F fireproofing system reduced temperature readings within the column's section by an average of 65%. Based on the experimental results, a parametric numerical study were developed and verified using ABAQUS software.

Strengthening the columns with PBO-FRCM significantly increased their resistance during fire, doubling fire-resistance duration with one layer. Adding fireproof insulation led to significant increase in load resistance duration. The percentage drop in temperature after 1 hour of fire exposure was around 70% at the FRCM surface for the insulated column strengthened with one layer of FRCM. Higher preload percentages reduced both the fire-resistance duration and ductility of the columns.

This study investigates the post-fire axial performance of square GFRP reinforced concrete (RC) columns, addressing a significant gap in current knowledge. Five column specimens of the same cross-section and length were tested, where the main parameters considered are the clear cover depths (40, 50, and 65 mm) and the use of a 40-mm insulation on one column. The columns were subjected to a long 3-hour fire exposure per ASTM E119 standard without sustained loading. The columns were tested upon cooling under concentric axial loading. Despite the notable temperature differences between columns with 40 and 65 mm concrete cover (300 and 500 °C after 3 hours), the post-fire residual axial capacity appeared unaffected. This is primarily attributed to the minimal differences in the retained mechanical properties of GFRP bars at temperatures exceeding 200 °C. The study's findings indicate that GFRP longitudinal bars do not significantly influence the performance of columns in fires. Consequently, future research should focus on columns reinforced with GFRP ties as well. The predicted values of post-fire axial capacity closely match the experimental data for non-insulated columns, indicating a high degree of accuracy. The study provides design recommendations to enhance the fire performance of such elements. The use of insulation results in a substantial reduction of temperature at various depths of the column.

The experimental results show that varying the test parameters have a significant impact on the shear capacity of the beams. For instance, decreasing the a/d ratio for the GFRP reinforced beams from 1.8 to 1.5 and from 1.8 to 1.1 increased the load carrying capacity by 33 % and 95 %, respectively. The experimental results for the shear capacity were compared against the predictions obtained using the strut and tie method as per the ACI-318–19 and CSA-S806-12 codes. The failure load predictions by the ACI and CSA code showed the same trends as those shown in the experimental results. Moreover, both codes were conservative in predicting the shear capacities."

    "abstract": "This comprehensive review paper delves into the utilization of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites within the realm of concrete column reinforcement, spotlighting the surge in structural engineering applications that leverage GFRP instead of traditional steel to circumvent the latter’s corrosion issues. Despite a significant corpus of research on GFRP-reinforced structural members, questions about their compression behavior persist, making it a focal area of this review. This study evaluates the properties of GFRP bars and their impact on the structural behavior of concrete columns, addressing variables such as concrete type and strength, cross-sectional geometry, slenderness ratio, and reinforcement specifics under varied loading protocols. With a dataset spanning over 250 publications from 1988 to 2024, our findings reveal a marked increase in research interest, particularly in regions like China, Canada, and the United States, highlighting GFRP’s potential as a cost-effective and durable alternative to steel. However, gaps in current knowledge, especially concerning Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) reinforced with GFRP, underscore the necessity for targeted research. Additionally, the contribution of GFRP rebars to compressive column capacity ranges from 5% to 40%, but current design codes and standards underestimate this, necessitating new models and design provisions that accurately reflect GFRP’s compressive behavior. Moreover, this review identifies other critical areas for future exploration, including the influence of cross-sectional geometry on structural behavior, the application of GFRP in seismic resistance, and the evaluation of the size effect on column strength. Furthermore, the paper calls for advanced studies on the long-term durability of GFRP-reinforced structures under various environmental conditions, environmental and economic impacts of GFRP usage, and the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in predicting the performance of GFRP-reinforced columns. Addressing these research gaps is crucial for developing more resilient and sustainable concrete structures, particularly in seismic zones and harsh environmental conditions, and fostering advancements in structural engineering through the adoption of innovative, efficient construction practices."

Various mix proportions incorporating different types and proportions of SCMs are examined to evaluate their effects on the compressive strength, flexural strength, and splitting tensile strength of the concrete. The basalt fiber (BF) was added in constant amount of 1% of binder weight to enhance flexural and tensile strengths. Fly ash and GGBS was used as SCMs at amounts of 0%, 30%, 70%, and 100% of binder weight to replace the silica fume. The results indicate that the inclusion of GGBS and fly ash to replace silica fume reduced the 28 days-compressive strength of concrete from 53.5 MPa to 22.3 MPa for HSC containing 100% GGBS and 19.4 MPa for HSC containing 100% fly ash.

To avoid the associated premature debonding failure, this study presents an experimental and analytical investigation on the use of bore-epoxy as an anchorage system for CFRP plates and sheets bonded on both sides of shear deficient RC beams of rectangular cross-sections. Nine (9) RC beams were prepared and strengthened with CFRP plates and sheets as EBR with bore-epoxy anchorage system considering different bore diameters and tested under four point bending. The results indicate that RC beams strengthened with bore-epoxy anchorage system have high shear strength as compared with the unstrengthened control beam and those strenghtended with the conventional EBR approach (without boring). The increase in the shear strength over the control beam was found to be up to 67 % and 121 % for cases of CFRP plates and sheets, respectively. Moreover, the increase of shear strength in comparison with the conventional EBR method ranged from 9.33 % to 20.36 % for CFRP plates and from 12.97 % to 36.10 % for CFRP sheets. Consistently, the contribution of bore-epoxy on the shear strength increased with the increase of bore diameter. Consequently, the existing formulas in the ACI440.2 R for predicting the shear strength of FRP strengthened RC beams were modified to incorporate the improvement made by the proposed bore-epoxy approach. The revised models predicted the experimental shear strength of RC beams, strengthened with bore-epoxy, with a good level of accuracy with average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 6.07 %, 14.71 %, normalized mean square error (NMSE) = 0.097, 0.16, and coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> = 0.912, 0.974 for plates and sheets, respectively."

The findings revealed that the addition of FA and DS influenced the microstructure of the FRC. Furthermore, the inclusion of FA contributed to improved pore structure and enhanced the pozzolanic reaction, resulting in a denser microstructure.

However, the vulnerability of FRP systems to elevated temperatures has raised a major concern and led researchers to explore different strengthening systems. This paper investigates the fire performance of circular RC columns strengthened with poly-paraphenylene-benzobisoxazole (PBO) fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) system. Four identical columns were cast, three of which were strengthened with varying number of layers of PBO-FRCM. The fire exposure followed ASTM E119 standards. The temperature response curves were analyzed, and post-fire conditions were assessed. Initially, columns with a greater number of PBO-FRCM layers exhibited significantly lower temperatures. As the fire exposure time increased, FRCM strengthened columns experienced more significant spalling than the control column, where the reinforcement was visible from all sides. This excessive concrete spalling resulted in matching temperature readings in both the strengthened and non-strengthened columns."

This innovative digital construction approach offers rapid, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions. The 3DCP walls used as load-bearing walls are an essential component and the primary section of the 3D printed constructions. Therefore, this study investigates the behavior of large-scale 3DCP walls under axial loading to evaluate their load-bearing capacity. The used mix consists of optimized materials, including glass fibers (GF) for fiber reinforcement, enhanced mechanical properties, and crack resistance. Rheological testing ensured the mix’s quality and efficiency, assessing properties like extrudability, flowability, and buildability. Mechanical tests confirmed the mix as high-strength concrete with 85 MPa compressive strength. Uniform axial compression loading tests were conducted to analyze the structural behavior, deformation, and crack patterns of 3DCP load-bearing walls with different cross-section configurations. The walls were categorized into two types: gapped walls, which include GLBW-3T (three-truss gapped wall), GLBW-4T (four-truss gapped wall), and GLBW-5T (five-truss gapped wall), and a solid wall (SLBW), which is a fully solid section designed to achieve the sectional maximum load-bearing capacity. In this study, material consumption was a key factor in identifying the optimal and economical structural efficiency. The SLBW exhibited the highest resistance to cracking with a crack load-to-volume ratio of 4.02 N/cm<sup>3</sup>. Conversely, GLBW-3T and GLBW-5T, both featuring gapped sections with varying truss configurations, showed similar efficiency with crack load-to-volume ratios of 3.12 N/cm<sup>3</sup> and 3.04 N/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. GLBW-4T demonstrated the least efficient performance, with a crack load-to-volume ratio of 2.48 N/cm<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, the crack pattern intensity and structural stability were highest in the SLBW, followed by the GLBW-3T, while, the GLBW-5T performed the least favorably.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of elliptical aspect ratio (A/B) as well as confinement rigidity (number of EB-FRP layers) on confinement effectiveness. The experimental program consisted of one series of control concrete columns (unstrengthened) and three additional series, each one strengthened with one, two and three layers of EB-CFRP sheets, respectively. Furthermore, each series considered five elliptical aspect ratios (A/B) ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Following compressive concentric tests until failure, the results were analyzed to characterize the confinement level with an increasing number of EB-CFRP layers as a function of the elliptical aspect ratio. The results show considerable enhancements in compressive strength and in the ductility of the confined columns. Furthermore, this improvement is amplified as the number of EB-CFRP layers increases, indicating a proportional relationship between the compressive strength and the number of CFRP layers. It is found that the ultimate strength of EB-CFRP-confined columns with three layers reached up to 130% compared to the control specimens. However, increasing the elliptical aspect ratio reduced the compressive strength and ductility of confined columns. This study investigated the relation between the CFRP hoop and axial strains and the elliptical aspect ratios. Moreover, through comparison, the results reveal that the prediction models proposed by the Canadian standards S806-12 and S6-19 do not capture the negative effect of the elliptical aspect ratio in confined concrete columns."

    "abstract": "The external bonding system using CFRP composite has been extensively utilized for strengthening different structures worldwide. However, premature debonding in this strengthening technique is a critical failure that leads to the fiber not reaching its ultimate capacity. In order to enhance the capacity of the externally bonded (EB) FRP and to slow the premature debonding failure mechanism, numerous anchoring techniques have been applied to improve the bonding capacity. The externally bonded reinforcement on grooves (EBROG) technology is one of the strategies that have been recently developed to delay the debonding issue. Although extensive studies have been conducted in the literature on the EBROG method, most of these studies have been focused on the bonding characteristics of grooves in the longitudinal direction, and few studies on the effect of different designs and configurations (e.g., width, height, and spacing) in the transverse groove direction have been conducted using only CFRP fabric. In the present study, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the bond behavior of the externally bonded reinforcement on transverse grooves (EBROTG) technique on CFRP-to-concrete joints involving different parameters, including groove width, depth, spaces between grooves, and strain evolution with the corresponding bond stress–slip relationships using CFRP laminate. Twenty-four concrete prisms, divided into eight groups of three specimens, were tested using a single-lap shear test set-up. The results of testing proved that the EBROTG method furnished a proper anchor system and highly enhanced the bonding force of the tests. The increasing range of bonding strength in the specimens reinforced with the transverse grooving method ranged from 11 to 86% compared to the externally bonded reinforcement (EBR), reflecting the effect of different widths, depths, and distances between grooves."

Basalt FRP (BFRP) and Glass FRP (GFRP) rebars were considered. Steel ties were provided at 60 mm spacing to significantly confine the columns. All the columns were square and had 180 mm cross-section dimensions and 1000 mm height. The type and diameter of longitudinal rebars varied between the columns. Concrete crushing governed the failure of BFRP and GFRP Reinforced Concrete (RC) columns, while steel yielding caused the failure in steel-RC columns. The axial load capacity was similar for BFRP and GFRP-RC columns,with only an 11% difference.Nevertheless, the differencewas only 2% for the BFRP-RC column in comparison with the steel-RC column of equivalent strength.

Research has continuously shown that lightweight concrete (LWC) is a potential sustainable alternative for normal weight concrete (NWC) due to incorporation of cement alternatives within the mix, higher resource efficiency, and enhanced thermal insulation. This paper investigates the residual properties of NWC and structural LWC at room temperature and when exposed to the following steady-state temperatures: 100℃, 200℃, 400℃, 600℃, and 800℃. Results show that LWC exhibit higher fire performance than NWC. At failure, NWC specimens majorly reported cone and split failure modes. The LWC specimens displayed mostly columnar failure modes. Spalling of concrete was first reported at 600°C on LWC at the corners of the specimens. At 800°C, surface spalling was reported on NWC only, indicating the higher fire resistive property of LWC. After heat exposure, discoloration was first observed in all specimens at 400°C. The compressive strength of both types of concrete initially increased after high-temperature exposure. Residual strength reported increase up to 200°C and 400°C for NWC and LWC, respectively. Consequently, significant decrease in compressive strength reaching around 20% of the original compressive strength when exposed to 800°C. Results showed that NWC experiences more reduction in residual strength than LWC, supporting that LWC is a promising construction material in enhancing structural fire safety."

Unfortunately, RCA is of poor quality due to the presence of old mortar attached to its surface. It is characterized by its low density, high absorption, low rigidity and a poor quality interfacial transition zone (ITZ) which results in a lower quality concrete. This experimental study aims to introduce together with RCA aggregates supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in order to reduce the decrease in mechanical performance, durability and microstructure of concrete. In a concrete based on RCA aggregates, ordinary cement was replaced with 20% natural pozzolan (NP), 10% limestone powder (LP), 20% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) or 10% fumed silica (SF). Concrete was studied in terms of workability, superplasticizer requirements, mechanical strength, water absorption and microstructure. The results reveal that SCM significantly improves the performance of RAC concrete by promoting filling effects, nucleation, pozzolanic reactions and hydraulic activity. In the long term, RAC concrete has a 12% lower strength than OAC concrete. This decrease is reduced to only 3% when using LP and even results in 9% and 28% higher strengths when using GGBFS or SF. Similarly, an improvement in structural porosity up to 28% is observed, which led to a significant reduction in shrinkage strain, ranging from 20% to 44%."

Therefore, their ability to withstand loads when exposed to fire is important. The behavior of RC walls under fire exposure is affected by various factors, such as slenderness ratio, concrete strength and composition, and axial load. This paper investigates the effect of slenderness ratio on the structural performance of RC walls subjected to fire. A series of numerical simulations were conducted on RC walls with different slenderness ratios. The simulations are performed on a three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model, after validating its thermal and structural behavior using previously published experimental data. The walls were exposed to standard fire curves (ISO834) on one side. The thermal and structural response of the walls were assessed in terms of axial deformations, out-of-plane deformations, and fire resistance. The results showed that slenderness ratio had a significant influence on the fire behavior of RC walls. The walls with higher slenderness ratios exhibited higher temperature gradients and larger deflections compared to the walls with lower slenderness ratios.

Six of the twelve plain concrete prisms were strengthened using CFRP laminates, while the remaining prisms were unstrengthened to serve as control specimens. After achieving 28 days of curing in standard lab conditions, all prisms were tested under a four-point bending test. The ultimate mid-span deflection, maximum and ultimate strains at the mid-span, strain distribution at different positions along the length of the laminate, and bond/shear stress versus slip were analyzed to evaluate the bond performance of flexural prisms. The average ultimate load-carrying capacities and mid-span deflection of the NSC and HSC groups were 31.33 and 35.02 kN and 0.55 and 1.54 mm, respectively. The average CFRP strain values at the mid-span corresponding to the ultimate load were 5005 and 3544 με for the NSC and HSC groups, respectively.

The investigation considered various web opening shapes; diamond, circular, and square strengthened with pre-stressed Fe-SMA bars. Results showed that web openings notably decrease the ultimate loads of beams by 53%, 44%, and 39% for square, circular, and diamond shapes, respectively. However, pre-stressed Fe-SMA bars enhanced the shear capacity of beams with unstrengthened web openings by approximately 60%, making their behavior comparable to solid beams. The proposed strengthening technique was most effective for diamond web openings, nearly restoring both shear strength and stiffness, while circular openings recovered nearly 90% of shear capacity and square openings about 75%. Additionally, Fe-SMA bars effectively controlled cracking at the corners of the openings. This study highlights the importance of strengthening web openings in RC beams, especially in shear zones, and provides significant insights into enhancing such beams, contributing to safer structural designs.

This paper presents an experimental study on the bond slip behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, applied to concrete structures under room temperature conditions. The experimental investigation involved the strengthening of three concrete prism specimens with CFRP sheets. The prism specimens were tested under a three-point bending setup. The bond slip phenomenon was analyzed using strain gauge readings attached to the CFRP laminate before testing. The calculated model aimed to accurately capture the bond slip behavior and its associated parameters, including the maximum shear stress, and maximum slip. These parameters were compared with theoretically derived formulas available in the literature. The theoretical equations overestimated the FRP stresses when compared to experimental measurements. The comparative analysis assesses the accuracy and reliability of the theoretical derivations by benchmarking it against the experimentally derived bond-slip model for CFRP-to-concrete joints."

Findings indicate that a 900 mm non-reinforced 3D-printed segment achieved about 65% of the load-bearing capacity of traditional reinforced concrete segment of the same size, with a maximum load capacity of 90 kN compared to the ACI318-19 design capacity of 135 kN, leading to a brittle failure mode. The maximum deflection recorded was 0.6 mm, demonstrating promising structural performance but limited ductility. The results will not only shed light on the structural behaviour of these innovative structures but also pave the way for the development of resilient and adaptive infrastructure systems. Additionally, the study explores the sustainability aspects of 3D printing technology, considering its potential to optimize material usage and construction processes. In conclusion, the investigation of the structural performance of 3D printed concrete bridge segments presents a promising avenue for advancing the field of construction materials and techniques. The outcomes of this research hold significant implications for the design and implementation of next-generation infrastructure projects, emphasizing sustainability, durability, and adaptability in the face of evolving environmental and structural challenges."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) continuous beams externally strengthened with strain-hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) layers. Although other techniques for strengthening continuous RC beams have been studied, limited attention has been given to the use of SHCC in these applications, particularly with discontinuities at the mid-support due to column heads. By addressing these gaps, this research advances the understanding of SHCC applications for retrofitting and provides a more realistic structural solution for strengthening such beams. The experimental program involved flexural testing of five RC continuous beams: one un-strengthened control beam and four strengthened with SHCC layers at the mid-support negative moment region. The strengthening configurations included two beams strengthened with L-shaped SHCC layers and two beams strengthened with U-shaped SHCC layers, extending to either half or full beam height. To overcome discontinuity at the column head, CFRP laminates were added to the L-shaped SHCC configurations. The control beam exhibited an ultimate load of 392 kN, while the strengthened beams exhibited failure loads that ranged from 418 to 496 kN, with the U-shaped configuration showing the highest load capacity of 496 kN, a 27 % increase. Debonding occurred in the L-shaped strengthened beams, while no debonding was observed in the U-shaped beams. A finite-element-based numerical model was developed using ABAQUS and was validated using experimental data. The Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) model was used for both concrete and SHCC, and cohesive surface-to-surface interaction was used to model the bond between the concrete and SHCC layers. The model showed good agreement with the experimental results and can be used for further parametric studies. This study concludes that SHCC strengthening is a viable solution for enhancing the flexural capacity of RC continuous beams."

    "abstract": "One of the main causes of failures in earth dams and embankments is internal erosion. This process initiates when seepage forces exceed the internal frictional resistance within soils. This paper investigates the effect of physical properties of soils that control failure due to internal erosion of soils such as plastic limit, cohesion and initial dry density. Three types of clayey soils with different properties were used in this research. Specimens were prepared to perform direct shear test and hole erosion test at different initial dry densities to find cohesion and internal erosion characteristics of soils. An effort was made to identify the relationship between engineering properties and internal erosion parameters of soil like critical shear stress and erosion rate index. Results show that increase in initial dry density and liquid limit of soil makes them less susceptible to erosion and increase the critical shear value. Moreover, equations were developed to predict both erosion rate index and critical shear based on the initial physical properties of the soils. The findings of this research will contribute in selecting the soils for dams and embankments and predict their behavior from proposed equations using simple geotechnical properties."

    "abstract": "Concrete is widely used in construction due to its remarkable compressive strength and durability. However, its performance can deteriorate when exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as acidic or alkaline surroundings. There has been considerable interest in incorporating both basalt and steel fibers (B&SFs) to enhance the resilience of concrete in such challenging settings. This study presents a comprehensive examination of the influence of B&SFs on the strength and microstructure of concrete, utilizing desert sand as a fine aggregate and subjecting it to exposure to acidic and alkaline environments. Employing a systematic experimental approach, this research assesses concrete samples with varying B&SFs proportions. The study encompasses density and compressive strength tests, complemented by microstructural analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), to analyze the performance of the concrete under diverse environmental conditions. Initial findings indicate that including B&SFs results in a substantial improvement in concrete strength. The role of basalt fibers (BFs) in enhancing the concrete's resistance to acidic environments by mitigating deleterious effects on microstructural integrity is particularly noteworthy. Notably, when exposed to acidic conditions, concrete mixtures containing 0.5% BFs demonstrated the least strength loss. When B&SFs are synergized, their positive effects are amplified, yielding concrete with exceptional resistance to alkaline environments. Microstructural analysis reveals that incorporating fibers refines and strengthens the interconnected matrix of cementitious products, thereby enhancing cohesion and overall strength. Furthermore, this study underscores that desert sand can be a viable alternative to traditional fine aggregates without compromising concrete resistance if it is appropriately reinforced with fibers. In conclusion, this research sheds light on the promising role of B&SFs in augmenting the strength and microstructure of concrete containing desert sand."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the use of bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks based digital predistortion for 5G applications. The proposed architecture uniquely combines two features that reduce the predistorter's update complexity. First, to accommodate the wideband nature of 5G signals, the proposed predistorter is identified from under-sampled feedback signals. This results in a significant reduction of the sampling rate required in the signal observation path. Furthermore, the proposed BiLSTM structure and its identification process make the synthesized predistortion function resilient to changes in the signal characteristics such as the average power, bandwidth and carriers configuration. Therefore, limiting the need for frequent update of the predistortion function. The proposed approach is validated experimentally on a GaN power amplifier prototype driven by 5G NR test signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the predistorter synthesized from a single characterization with a 30MHz test signal acquired at 46Msps is able to linearize the power amplifier over a 5dB range of operating average power, and different signal bandwidths with various carriers configurations."

In this paper, we focus on accurate prediction of the network throughput to improve the QoE in the context of DASH applications. Specifically, we focus on prediction of realtime throughput across different mobility patterns using 4G dataset traces collected in Ireland. Therefore, we propose an innovative throughput prediction framework using the Autoformer deep learning model, which is specifically designed to capture long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. Autofomer models outperform the state-of-the-art LSTM-based models, achieving significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of more than 70 % in some mobility scenarios. Further, we propose replacing the traditional estimation module in DASH players with the Autoformer-based prediction model to enhance overall perceptual video quality."

However, real-life deployments of such algorithms assume that the third-party application implementing DP-based FL is trusted, and is thus given access to sensitive data on the data owner’s device/server. In this work, we propose DPWatch, a hardware-based framework for ML accelerators that enforces guarantees that a third party application cannot leak sensitive user data used for training and ensures that the gradients are appropriately noised before leaving the device.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the quality of video coding whilst maintaining compliance with the syntax of video coding standards is challenging. In the literature, many solutions have been proposed that apply mainly to two-pass encoding, bitrate control algorithms, and enhancements of locally decoded images in the motion-compensation loop. This work proposes a pre- and post-coding solution using the content-symmetrical multidimensional transpose of raw video sequences. The content-symmetrical multidimensional transpose results in images composed of slices of the temporal domain whilst preserving the video content. Such slices have higher spatial homogeneity at the expense of reducing the temporal resemblance. As such, an all-intra configuration is an excellent choice for compressing such images. Prior to displaying the decoded images, a content-symmetrical multidimensional transpose is applied again to restore the original form of the input images. Moreover, we propose a lightweight two-pass encoding solution in which we apply systematic temporal subsampling on the multidimensional transposed image sequences prior to the first-pass encoding. This noticeably reduces the complexity of the encoding process of the first pass and gives an indication as to whether or not the proposed solution is suitable for the video sequence at hand. Using the HEVC video codec, the experimental results revealed that the proposed solution results in a lower percentage of coding unit splits in comparison to regular HEVC coding without the multidimensional transpose of image sequences. This finding supports the claim of there being increasing spatial coherence as a result of the proposed solution. Additionally, using four quantization parameters, and in comparison to regular HEVC encoding, the resulting BD rate is −15.12%, which indicates a noticeable bitrate reduction. The BD-PSNR, on the other hand, was 1.62 dB, indicating an enhancement in the quality of the decoded images. Despite all of these benefits, the proposed solution has limitations, which are also discussed in the paper."

To give an example of these inaccuracies, publications on fuel technology, nuclear engineering, and all energy-related studies are classified under Civil Engineering in THE ranking and under Electrical and Electronics Engineering under the QS ranking. This is completely unfair as many of these studies are conducted by researchers in Mechanical or Chemical engineering disciplines.

    "abstract": "Many recent video games require powerful hardware to render them. To reduce such high hardware requirements, upscalers have been proposed in the literature and industry. Upscalers save computing resources by first rendering games at lower resolutions and frame rates and then upscaling them to improve players' quality of experience. Current upscalers, however, are tightly coupled with the rendering logic of video games, which requires updating the source code of each game for every upscaler. This increases the development cost and limits the use of upscalers. The tight coupling also stifles the deployment of upscalers in cloud gaming platforms to reduce the required computing resources. We propose decoupling upscalers from game renderers, which allows utilizing various upscalers with games without changing their source code. It also accelerates deploying upscalers in cloud gaming. Decoupling upscalers from renderers is, however, challenging because of the diversity of upscalers, their dependency on information at different rendering stages, and the strict timing requirements of video games. We present an efficient solution that addresses these challenges. We implement the proposed solution and demonstrate its effectiveness with two popular upscalers. We also develop a cloud gaming system in the emerging Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) protocol and implement the proposed approach with it. Our experiments show the potential savings in computing resources while meeting the strict timing constraints of video games."

This survey addresses this gap by systematically categorizing and analyzing recent research on learning techniques applied to adaptive video encoding, bandwidth optimization, and quality adaptation. Emerging trends and open challenges are identified, providing researchers with timely insights into how learning algorithms can be used to shape the future of adaptive streaming systems."

    "abstract": "In video summarization, four datasets (TvSum, SumMe, OVP, and YouTube) are typically used for training and testing. In this study, we supplement these datasets with novel features based on High Efficiency Video Codec (HEVC) video coding and motion estimation and compensation. Although HEVC coding variables offer valuable information, they are frequently overlooked in deep learning solutions for video analysis. Thus, we introduce a low-level HEVC feature set suitable for dynamic video summarization. Additionally, we supplement the datasets with additional feature vectors based on CNN embeddings of Window-based Accumulated Image Differences with motion estimation and compensation (WAID-MC). We integrate our two proposed feature sets using feature vector fusion and importance score fusion. Furthermore, we enhance the OVP and YouTube datasets by adding ground truth keyshots, importance scores, and user summaries. In the experimental results section, we compare our proposed solutions with four existing approaches, integrating our features and fusion techniques into their codebases. Our findings indicate that in a minimum of three out of the four datasets, the F1 scores achieved by our proposed methodologies are superior to those of existing studies. Moreover, the experimental results predominantly highlight feature vector fusion as superior to importance score fusion. In many instances, the fusion of the WAID-MC features with the HEVC features yields the best F1 scores. In some cases, the utilization of HEVC features alone results in higher F1 scores compared to existing approaches."

The optimization combines economic assessments of assignable cause costs with statistical enhancements to the chart’s detection speed. The goal is to lower the Expected Total Cost (ETC) while keeping false alarm rates and inspections within set limits. This approach is expected to increase process efficiency, reduce quality costs, and ensure quality. A responsiveness analysis for the optimized chart against traditional methods is conducted, considering various costs, designs, and shifts.

    "abstract": "Cloud computing enables users to access and utilize various computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, and analytics. This paradigm offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, making it a critical technology for numerous applications. In the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure for managing the vast amount of data generated by IoT devices. Specifically, in Industrial Internet of Things applications (IIoT), predictive maintenance has become a key focus, leveraging advanced technologies to forecast equipment failures and minimize downtime. However, achieving high accuracy in fault prediction remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Brokenstick Regression-based Multiobjective Dragonfly Predictive Optimization (BR-MDPO). This method aims to optimize predictive maintenance with enhanced accuracy and execution time. The process begins with IoT devices collecting data, such as vibration, temperature, speed, torque, and operational hours, from industrial machinery. This data is then sent to centralized cloud data centers for predictive analysis. The BR-MDPO technique utilizes the Multi-Objective Dragonfly Optimization algorithm, a metaheuristic inspired by the natural behavior of dragonflies, to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Brokenstick regression analyzes the data to optimize various objective functions. The technique identifies potential failures, facilitating proactive maintenance and informed decision-making to ensure continuous productivity. The proposed method shows a significant improvement in accuracy, precision, and recall by 7%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. The observed results reveal a 6%, 4% and 5% enhancement in the accuracy, precision, and recall. Furthermore, the proposed technique realizes a substantial reduction in error rate by 68%, 15% and 13% reduction in execution time as well as latency compared to conventional methods."

The emergence of edge intelligence enables these service goals achievable for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) compared with cloud-centric approaches. To assist medical personnel in intensive care units (ICU), we present the design of a network edge gateway that performs resource-efficient, real-time data analytics. We develop a cloud-configurable deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) core with an adaptable hardware architecture that executes four different types of analysis on an edge gateway. Our developed IP core adaptively switches from one architecture to another only in one clock cycle, based on the type of input features. The proposed IP core analyzes raw multimodal signals such as ECG, PPG, accelerometer, and other to discover anomalies in critically ill patients and their surroundings. We have validated the robustness of our developed model by comparing it with benchmark machine learning models and their previous implementations. The results show that our adaptive DNN model has obtained a software accuracy of 99.2% for ECG, 91.4% for PPG, 95% for activity classification, and 98.7% for smoke detection with a five-fold cross-validation strategy. Three versions of adaptive DNN IP cores (8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit) are implemented on SoC/FPGA and compared together to study the effect of bit precision on accuracy, resource utilization, and power consumption. The developed adaptive DNN IP cores with 16-bits require 680 nanoseconds with a power consumption of 309 milliwatts for a single inference with a speed of 1.47 mega samples per second. Our analysis shows that the decentralization of intelligence in the IP core reduces data size from 96.25% to 98.75%. This flexible IP core has achieved significant power and resource utilization performance compared to independent implementation without compromising latency and throughput."

    "abstract": "Dual-band power amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in modern wireless communication systems. Compared to single band PAs, dual-band PAs enable efficient utilization of spectrum resources with lower capital and operational expenses. In modern applications, inherent nonlinearities in PAs are unavoidable and can significantly degrade signal quality causing significant spectrum regrowth. These nonlinearities, already problematic in the case of single band systems, become considerably worse in dual-band systems with the generation of a plethora of intermodulation and cross-modulation products. These are even more challenging since the dominant distortions products can vary depending on the carrier aggregation scenario and, most importantly, the spacing between the two bands. Digital predistortion (DPD) techniques are mature for single band PAs; however, there are still numerous challenges for their adoption in dual-band and multi-band systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of dual-band digital predistorters, including polynomial based, hybrid, and neural networks based predistorters.

This input incorporates more physical domain knowledge than the widely used backpropagation (BP) estimate, which corresponds to the zeroth iteration of the CSI. While the non-iterative BP estimate is popular due to its simplicity, this work demonstrates that using ITER10 enhances reconstruction accuracy without significantly increasing computational cost. For comparison and the validation of choosing ITER10, the performance of the ATTN-Unet is evaluated using estimates from other intermediate CSI iterations, namely ITER5, 20, 30, and 40. Further, the network outputs are the reconstructed relative complex permittivity values (real and imaginary ) of an imaged object. The networks are tested using synthetic and experimental datasets. The results show that the ITER10-ATTN-Unet significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy, outperforming both the BP-ATTN-Unet and the conventional CSI method. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the ITER10-ATTN-Unet achieves a better balance between accuracy and computational cost compared to the other ITER-based models.

However, these methods rely on human experts and are time-consuming in terms of updates and may not exhaust all attack types especially zero-day attacks. Deep learning has shown some promise in intrusion detection. This paper shows that it is possible to use generative deep learning methods like Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) and Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) to detect intruders based on an analysis of the network data. The recently posted full IoT-23 dataset based on Somfy door lock, Philips Hue and Amazon Echo devices was used to train generative deep learning models to detect a variety of attacks like DDoS, and various botnets like Mirai, Okiruk and Torii.

First, the acquired CSI values associated with each recorded activity instance are processed to remove the existing noise from the recorded data. A novel segmentation algorithm is then presented to identify and extract the portion of the signal that contains the activity. Next, the extracted activity segment is processed using the procedure proposed in the first stage. After that, the relevant features are extracted, and the important features are selected. Finally, the selected features are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the different performed activities.

The challenges addressed in this paper include keeping the encrypted video compliant with standardized decoders, correctly decrypting the video and finally, correctly extracting the message bits. The message embedding is achieved by altering the values of reference picture indices and motion vectors which results in scrambled video. Sixteen picture references are used in this work and therefore, combined with alteration of motion vectors, a maximum of six message bits can be embedded per coding unit. Motion vectors are altered by swapping their x and y components and/or changing their signs. This is achieved with full compliance with the HEVC video syntax. To extract message bits, an authorized decoder builds a classification model per video sequence and uses it for predicting the true values of the reference indices and motion vectors. As such, message bits are extracted and the video is correctly reconstructed to its unscrambled state. Coding units that result in misclassification are identified at the encoder and excluded from message embedding. This results in slightly lower embedding rates but ensures accurate video reconstruction. Using nine video sequences of various resolutions that are compressed using four different quantization parameters, the experimental results revealed that the true average message embedding rate is 2.7 bits per coding unit or 173 kbit/s. This is achieved with accurate video reconstruction at the expense of increasing the bitrate of the encoder by 3%. Comparison with existing work shows that the proposed solution is superior in terms of embedding capacity whilst reducing the excessive bitrate of the encoder."

    "abstract": "In cluster-based information-centric wireless sensor networks (ICWSNs), mobile sensor nodes are grouped into clusters in rounds. In each cluster, a cluster head (CH) is selected, which collects, aggregates, and forwards locally sensed data to a sink node. CHs further store a copy of data for the round period to act as cache nodes and deliver data to mobile users upon requests. Nevertheless, clustering and securing mobile ICWSNs are challenging. This is because, in addition to sensor nodes' and users' mobility, sensor nodes are often resource constrained. Therefore, clustering and security resource allocation in mobile ICWSNs should be carefully redesigned to ensure efficient ICWSN operation, data security, and timely data access to mobile users. This article proposes a node embedding with security resource allocation (NESRA) clustering algorithm for mobile ICWSNs in rounds. NESRA allocates security resources to sensor nodes based on the location, mobility, and energy resources available in the first step. An optimization problem is formulated to select CHs that maximize network coverage and minimize data delivery delay to mobile users in the second step. In the third step, NESRA utilizes network representation learning that embeds sensor nodes' location, mobility, and expected energy expenditure features into a 2-D space to form well-separated clusters of sensing nodes. Compared to existing works, NESRA achieves lower energy consumption, nodes' death rate, and latency and allows higher throughput and cache nodes' utilization with stable data security. Still, NESRA has some challenges to overcome in high-mobility networks."

The accuracy assessment showed that the targeted 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2017 classification maps have 89.9%, 91.04%, 93.31% and 97.121% accuracy, respectively. The results showed that the built-up area increased by 12.22 km<sup>2</sup> (1.76%) between 2000 and 2005 and continues to increase even up until the present time. The assessment of changes in the periods 2000–2005 and 2010–2017 confirmed that the net vegetation area increases were less pronounced from 2000 to 2005 than from 2010 to 2017, increasing from 7.26 to 54.69 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The proposed approach will offer great help to environmental engineers and decision-makers in the development of future environmental issues and investigate the impact of LULC change on groundwater level and quality."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel health index (HI) based adaptive prognostics method by leveraging the advantages of both data fusion to handle multi-dimensional data and the adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) algorithm for parameter identification in the diffusion process. A fitness metric is proposed for feature selection, and then the composite HI sequence is constructed via data fusion using the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, a diffusion process model is built to characterize HI degradation while considering multi-source uncertainties. Model parameters are then updated using the fitting-based AEKF method. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a real-world dataset of solid-state drives in data centers, and prediction results and comparative studies verify its superiority."

    "abstract": "Data embedding in videos has several important applications including Digital Rights Management, preserving confidentiality of content, authentication and tampering detection. This paper proposes a novel data embedding solution in scrambled videos by rotating motion vectors of predicted macroblocks. The rotation of motion vectors and the propagation of motion compensation error serve another purpose, which is video scrambling. A compliant decoder uses machine learning to counter-rotate the motion vectors and extract embedded message bits. To achieve this, the decoder uses a sequence-dependent approach to train a classifier to distinguish between macroblocks reconstructed using rotated and un-rotated motion vectors. In the testing phase, motion vectors belonging to a classified macroblock are compared against the reviewed rotated motion vectors and the message bits are extracted. Furthermore, to guarantee accurate classification at the decoder, a constrained encoding approach is proposed in which data embedding is restricted to motion vectors that can be correctly counter-rotated at the decoder. The proposed solution is referred to as Classifying Rotated Vectors or CRVs for short. Experimental results revealed that scrambled videos can be reconstructed correctly without quality loss with a bitrate increase at the encoder of around 6% and an average data embedding rate of 1.68 bits per MB."

Unlike most of the work in this area, this paper deals with theft in the generation domain, not the consumption domain. In specific, the objective of this work is to apply regression machine learning to detect electricity theft in photovoltaic (PV) generation. We propose a new theft detection approach based on a regression tree model to identify suspicious information. The proposed approach relies on a combination of machine learning and statistical analysis, where the error between the estimated PV output and the reported PV output is used to classify the customer. If the error is highly unlikely to happen, then the customer is classified as malicious; otherwise, the customer is honest. For testing and training, we use 25 different panels, where 24 panels are used for training and the 25th panel is used for testing.

In 4D-CBCT, projections are sorted into bins based on their respiratory phase and a 3D image is reconstructed from each bin. However, the quality of the resulting 4D-CBCT images is limited by the streaking artifacts that result from having an insufficient number of projections in each bin. In this work, an interpolation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is proposed to generate new in-between projections to increase the overall number of projections used in 4D-CBCT reconstruction. Projections simulated using XCAT phantom were used to assess the proposed method. The interpolated projections using the proposed method were compared to the corresponding original projections by calculating the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), root mean square error (RMSE), and structural similarity index measurement (SSIM). Moreover, the results of the proposed method were compared to the results of existing standard interpolation methods, namely, linear, spline, and registration-based methods. The interpolated projections using the proposed method had an average PSNR, RMSE, and SSIM of 35.939, 4.115, and 0.968, respectively. Moreover, the results achieved by the proposed method surpassed the results achieved by the existing interpolation methods tested on the same dataset.

These include GoogleNet, AlexNet, Inception-ResNet-v2, and VGG16. The modified datasets are made publicly available to the research community. Before detecting keyframes in a video, it is important to identify and eliminate duplicate or similar video frames. A subset of the proposed HEVC feature set was used to identify these frames and eliminate them from the video. We also propose an elimination solution based on the sum of the absolute differences between a frame and its motion-compensated predecessor. The proposed solutions are compared with existing works based on an SIFT flow algorithm that uses CNN features. Subsequently, an optional dimensionality reduction based on stepwise regression was applied to the feature vectors prior to detecting key frames. The proposed solution is compared with existing studies that use sparse autoencoders with CNN features for dimensionality reduction. The accuracy of the proposed key-frame detection system was assessed using the positive predictive values, sensitivity, and F-scores. Combining the proposed solution with Multi-CNN features and using a random forest classifier, it was shown that the proposed solution achieved an average F-score of 0.98."

Unlike the existing hybrid BA relaying schemes and opportunistic relying schemes, the proposed scheme considers the average buffering delay and uses probabilistic relay selection (RS) instead of using a fixed RS policy. It probabilistically prioritizes the selection of one of the FD and HD modes over the other. Markov chain (MC) theory is used to model the considered system and derive the throughput, average delay and outage probability as functions of the prioritizing probabilities. Based on the buffer and average channel states, the prioritizing probabilities are determined such that the overall average delay is minimized using the accelerated proximal gradient method.

Adding FPGAs to a cloud environment involves non-trivial challenges. The first challenge is virtualizing FPGAs as part of the cloud resources. As a standard virtualization framework is lacking, there is a need for an efficient framework for virtualizing FPGAs. Furthermore, FPGA resources are used in conjunction with central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the execution of tasks. Therefore, to gain the benefits of these powerful accelerating platforms, the second challenge is to optimize the allocation of tasks into the capable resources within a cloud data center. This work proposes an FPGA virtualization framework that abstracts the physical FPGAs into virtual pools of FPGA resources. The work further presents an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization model to minimize the makespan of tasks where FPGA resources are part of the cloud data center. Given the complex nature of the problem, a simulated annealing (SA) metaheuristic is developed to achieve gains in performance compared to the exact method and to scale up and handle many tasks and resources while providing near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that SA has reduced the makespan of a large dataset with 1000 tasks and 100 resources by up to 30% when compared to first-come-first-served (FCFS) and shortest-deadline-first (SDF) algorithms. Lastly, to quantify the performance of FPGA-enabled cloud datacenters, the work extends the CloudSim simulator (an open-source cloud simulator) to enable FPGA as a resource in its environment. The proposed virtualization framework and the SA scheduler are integrated into the environment. Simulation results show that the execution time of tasks is reduced by up to 78% when FPGA accelerators are used."

In this paper, we develop a mobile plant care support system (“AgroAId”), which incorporates computer vision technology to classify a plant’s [species–disease] combination from an input plant leaf image, recognizing 39 [species-and-disease] classes. Our method comprises a comparative analysis to maximize our multi-label classification model’s performance and determine the effects of varying the convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, transfer learning approach, and hyperparameter optimizations. We tested four lightweight, mobile-optimized CNNs—MobileNet, MobileNetV2, NasNetMobile, and EfficientNetB0—and tested four transfer learning scenarios (percentage of frozen-vs.-retrained base layers): (1) freezing all convolutional layers; (2) freezing 80% of layers; (3) freezing 50% only; and (4) retraining all layers. A total of 32 model variations are built and assessed using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices). The most lightweight, high-accuracy model is concluded to be an EfficientNetB0 model using a fully retrained base network with optimized hyperparameters, achieving 99% accuracy and demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach; it is integrated into our plant care support system in a TensorFlow Lite format alongside the front-end mobile application and centralized cloud database. Finally, our system also uses the collective user classification data to generate spatiotemporal analytics about regional and seasonal disease trends, making these analytics accessible to all system users to increase awareness of global agricultural trends."

    "abstract": "Effective maintenance management of medical technology influences healthcare service quality delivery and the profitability of healthcare facilities. The objective of this study is to review recent research focused on medical equipment predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance is a term that describes the use of sensors and forecasting techniques to anticipate when a device or machine would fail, so that preemptive measures can be undertaken to lessen the effects of an impending failure and subsequently improve service quality. In healthcare, this mostly pertains to medical devices and can be an invaluable tool that would save medical institutions money and time, and more importantly, mitigate adverse effects to patients that require these devices. Predictive maintenance is a means of providing some control in an otherwise chaotic and arbitrary industry; doctors, nurses, and administrators often do not see the value in repairing or replacing a device before it fails, especially if it were not crucial in their day-to-day or emergency operation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of work that pertains to predictive maintenance in healthcare published between 2014 and 2019. The works reviewed were published in scientific journals and conferences, and for each one, we were interested in (1) what predictive maintenance techniques were used, such as Internet of Things (IoT) or deep learning (DL), (2) what devices/equipment were used to obtain results and (3) whether or not they were medical devices/healthcare-related, if not, how could this application apply to healthcare and (4) whether or not predictive maintenance is proven to be more effective than simply waiting for the lifespan of the device to come to its end. The reviewed papers all showed great potential in the techniques used for predictive maintenance and showed promising results for a variety of medical devices. The significance of this work lies in helping healthcare professionals realize the potential benefit that predictive maintenance can bring to the table, and how it fits with the cost-sensitive nature of the industry."

Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GAN) and deep learning have contributed greatly to multiple interesting applications in the domain of anime, particularly in face generation, style transfer, and colorization. However, there are no existing implementations for generating composite anime posters with a genre accompaniment prompt. This work proposes a novel application of genre to anime poster generation conditioned on BERT-tokenized binary genre-tags of light-hearted or heavy-hearted categorized based on the thematic subject content of the medium. A dataset of 9,840 image with genre tags and synopses was constructed by scraping MyAnimeList. The conditional Deep Convolution GAN with Spectral Normalization produced the best posters, achieving the quantitative scores of FID: 90.17, average IS: 3.505, 1KNN with PSNR: 0.445 across inter-label discernability, and FID: 166.4, across genuine versus generated poster distinguishability. The primary contribution of this work is to present results outlining the feasibility of various GAN architectures in synthesizing controllable and complex composite anime posters. The larger implication of this project is to provide an introductory approach showing the promise of a creativity assistant for authors, artists, and animators, where they can simply enter a key phrase representing a concept they have in mind, to generate a baseline idea as an initial phase."

This research aims to develop, design and test a smart system that detects defects, categorizes them and uses this knowledge to enhance the quality of subsequent parts. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed system integrates data collected from the deep learning module with the machine learning module to develop and improve two regression models. One determines if set process parameters would yield a defective product while the second model optimizes them. The deep learning model utilizes final product images to categorize the part as defective or not and determines the type of defect based on image analysis. The developed framework of the system was applied to the forging process to determine its feasibility during actual manufacturing. Findings: Results reveal that implementation of such a smart process would lead to significant contributions in enhancing manufacturing processes through higher production rates of acceptable products and lower scrap rates or rework. The role of machine learning is evident due to numerous benefits which include improving the accuracy of the regression model prediction. This artificial intelligent system enhances itself by learning which process parameters could lead to a defective product and uses this knowledge to adjust the process parameters accordingly overriding any manual setting. Research limitations/implications: The proposed system was applied only to the forging process but could be extended to other manufacturing processes. Originality/value: This paper studies how an artificial intelligent (AI) system can be developed and used to enhance the yield of good products."

The integration of conventional maintenance concepts with disruptive technological developments leads to significant changes in current maintenance practices in a response to the digitalized context requirements. However, despite the availability of technology and its relative affordability, many maintenance digital transformation (MDT) initiatives fail to accomplish their goals. This is due to the fact that technology alone is not sufficient for an organization to successfully digitalize its operations. Several challenges including the absence of a business case, limited analytical capabilities, uncertainties about new technologies, and impact of the human factor are hindering the success of attempted MDT efforts. MDT enablers reflect various aspects and span different implicated areas of the organization. This study seeks to develop a comprehensive and structured list of the underpinning factors driving the success of MDT. To that end, the authors conducted a systematic literature review in order to extract the various factors highlighted in the literature. Subsequently, a purification phase was conducted which consisted of merging the redundant factors together, then mapping them into various thematic categories based on the aspect covered. The final consolidated list comprises 63 enablers of MDT that are classified into 14 categories.

    "abstract": "Scheduling of Device-to-Device (D2D) links in communication networks conventionally relies on solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These types of solution approaches will not be suitable for the service requirements of future networks due to the associated computational complexity. That is why Deep Learning (DL) is one of the promising approaches to tackle this problem. Nevertheless, designing the learning algorithm to cope with the dynamic nature of the D2D network is a challenge. Current research using DL only assumes a static layout of the network without taking advantage of the correlations between the decisions in a dynamic network. Consequently, this paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence modelling (SSM) method for D2D scheduling using only distance information. The SSM processes the distance information as well as the previous scheduling decisions in a sequential manner with a feedback from the intermediate output, and models the correlations between consecutive input information as well as the produced decisions. Simulation results show that the average sum rate of the SSM is about 95% of that achieved by the optimal scheduler and it requires at least 90% less resources than those required by other DL schedulers reported in the literature. Finally, the decision-making of SSM is explored for key input descriptors and an unsupervised decision-maker is explored, which is shown to produce reasonable results with minimal computational requirements."

In a decentralized environment, each specification of the domain reflects an Ontological view. However, the semantics characterization of information systems in such decentralized environment poses a significant issue related to their integration. Information systems are viewed as independent intensional entities with their own beliefs, distinct from those held by others. Such autonomy is distorted by traditional extensional semantics. Other entities’ beliefs are introduced into a given entity, thus affecting their beliefs. Additionally, the information that one entity provides to another entity may not be consistent with the information known by the latter. We need an alternative semantics for information integration, which is not dependent on the extension, but rather on the underlying conceptualization. This paper proposes a classification of the environment where the information systems lives and a novel modelling paradigm for information integration using intensional logic to model the ontological views. The model comprises a formal modeling approach for the conceptualization as well as for the semantic integration process."

Based on the integration of machine learning (ML) and geographic information system (GIS), we employed a framework to delineate future urban boundaries for future expansion and urban agglomerations. We developed it based on a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) that depends on equal time intervals of urban growth. Such an approach is used for the first time in urban growth as a predictive tool and is coupled with Land Suitability Analysis, which incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data to propose evaluated urban growth in the Greater Irbid Municipality, Jordan. The results show the recommended future spatial expansion and proposed results for the year 2025. The results show that urban growth is more prevalent in the eastern, northern, and southern areas and less in the west. The urban growth boundary map illustrates that the continuation of urban growth in these areas will slowly further encroach upon and diminish agricultural land. By means of suitability analysis, the results showed that 51% of the region is unsuitable for growth, 43% is moderately suitable and only 6% is suitable for growth. Based on TDNN methodology, which is an ML framework that is dependent on the growth of urban boundaries, we can track and predict the trend of urban spatial expansion and thus develop policies for protecting ecological and agricultural lands and optimizing and directing urban growth."

    "abstract": "Systematic classroom observation is often used in evaluating and enhancing the quality of classroom instruction. However, classroom observation can potentially suffer from human bias. In addition, the traditional classroom observation is too expensive for resource-constrained environments (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central Asia). A cost-effective automation of classroom observation could potentially enhance both quality and resolution of feedback to the teacher, and hence potentially result in enhancing quality of instruction. Audio-based automatic classroom observation using supervised deep learning techniques has yielded good results in limited contexts. However, one challenge when using supervised techniques is the high cost of collecting and labelling the classroom audio data. One solution for such data-starved scenarios is to use semi-supervised learning (SSL) which requires significantly lesser data and labels. This paper explores an audio-adaptation of the state-of-the-art SSL FixMatch algorithm to automate classroom observation. An adaptation of the FixMatch algorithm was proposed to automate the coding for the Stallings class observation system. The proposed system was trained on classroom audio data collected in the wild. The supervised approach had an F1-score of 0.83 on 100% labeled data. The proposed FixMatch adaptation achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.81 on 20% labeled data, 0.79 on 15% labeled data, 0.76 on 10% labeled data, and 0.72 using only 5% of labeled data. This suggests that algorithms like FixMatch that use consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have a great potential for being used to automate classroom observation using a small labelled set of audio snippets."

In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system.

We then combine the sentiment features with the four image-text features obtained in the aforementioned previous works to train an MLP. This classifies sets of inputs into being out-of-context (OOC) or not-out-of-context (NOOC). On a test set of 400 samples, the MLP with all features achieved a score of 87.25%, and that with only the image-text features a score of 88%. In addition to the challenge requirements, we also propose a separate pipeline to automatically construct caption pairs and annotations using the images and captions provided in the large, un-annotated training dataset. We hope that this endeavor will open the door for improvements, since hand-annotating cheapfake labels is time-consuming. To evaluate the performance on the test set, the Docker image with the models is available at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/malkaddour/mmsys22cheapfakes.

Many of these methods are not applicable to ‘high-dimension, low sample size’ scenarios. With rapid technological advancement, high-dimensional data has become omnipresent in industrial applications. We propose a distribution-free change-point monitoring method applicable to high-dimensional data. Through an extensive simulation study, performance comparison has been done for different parameter values, under different multivariate distributions with complex dependence structures. The proposed method is robust and efficient in detecting change points under a wide range of shifts in the process distribution.

    "abstract": "Camera traps are an important tool for ecologists in their fight against ever increasing animal extinction. However, the use of these camera traps involves the tedious process of manually labeling the animals in captured images. An added hinderance is that of empty images triggered by wind movement and other stimuli called ghost images. Deep learning techniques have previously been applied to automate this task but have been prevented from being entirely effective due to two problems. Firstly, a lack of labeled data due to the expertise of ecologists being required to perform the labeling and secondly the training data being imbalanced in nature due to the high presence of ghost images and images of common animals. Many semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms perform well using very small amount of labelled data however need to be evaluated when trained with imbalance data. This paper explores the performance of FixMatch and a derivative called the Auxiliary Balanced Classifier (ABC) under a variety of data imbalance and proportions of labelled data. The algorithms were evaluated using a in the wild imbalanced dataset from camera traps in addition to benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. While FixMatch showed a consistent drop in performance as the data imbalance was increased, the algorithm generally outperformed ABC. However, the ABC derivative performed better than FixMatch in cases of very high imbalance."

This paper provides a focused review of the literature addressing applications of emerging ML tools to solve various Project Scheduling Problems (PSPs). In particular, it employs bibliometric and network analysis tools along with a systematic literature review to analyze a pool of 104 papers published between 1985 and August 2021. The conducted analysis unveiled the top contributing authors, the most influential papers as well as the existing research tendencies and thematic research topics within this field of study. A noticeable growth in the number of relevant studies is seen recently with a steady increase as of the year 2018. Most of the studies adopted Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Network and Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle PSPs under a stochastic environment, where these techniques are frequently hybridized with classical metaheuristics. The majority of works (57%) addressed basic Resource Constrained PSPs and only 15% are devoted to the project portfolio management problem. Furthermore, this study clearly indicates that the application of AI techniques to efficiently handle PSPs is still in its infancy stage bringing out the need for further research in this area. This work also identifies current research gaps and highlights a multitude of promising avenues for future research."

This paper offers innovative approaches to the problem of key frame extraction for the purpose of video summarization.

Once the features are extracted and their dimensionality is reduced, we apply innovative frame-level temporal subsampling techniques, followed by training and testing using deep learning architectures. The frame-level temporal subsampling techniques are based on cosine similarity and the PCA projections of feature vectors.

Influenced by ideas from STPA we present a hierarchical analysis process that aims to justify the design and flow-down of derived critical requirements arising from safety hazards and security vulnerabilities identified at the system level. At each level, we verify that the design achieves the safety/security requirements by backing the analysis with formal modelling and proof using Event-B refinement. The formal model helps to identify hazards/vulnerabilities arising from the design and how they relate to the safety accidents/security losses being considered at this level. We then re-apply the same process to each component of the design in a hierarchical manner. Thus we use ideas from STPA, backed by Event-B models, to drive the design, replacing the system level requirements with component requirements. In doing so, we decompose critical requirements down to components, transforming them from abstract system level requirements, towards concrete solutions that we can implement correctly so that the hazards/vulnerabilities are eliminated."

    "abstract": "Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children below 5 years old. Hence, the early detection of pediatric pneumonia is crucial to reduce its morbidity and mortality rates. Even though chest radiography is the most commonly employed modality for pneumonia detection, recent studies highlight the existence of poor interobserver agreement in the chest X-ray interpretation of healthcare practitioners when it comes to diagnosing pediatric pneumonia. Thus, there is a significant need for automating the detection process to minimize the potential human error. Since Artificial Intelligence tools such as Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) have the potential to automate disease detection, many researchers explored how such tools can be implemented to detect pneumonia in chest X-rays. Notably, the majority of efforts tackled this problem from a DL point of view. However, ML has shown a higher potential for medical interpretability while being less computationally demanding than DL. Objective: The aim of this paper is to automate the early detection process of pediatric pneumonia using ML as it is less computationally demanding than DL. Methods: The proposed approach entails performing data augmentation to balance the classes of the utilized dataset, optimizing the feature extraction scheme, and evaluating the performance of several ML models. Moreover, the performance of this approach is compared to a TL benchmark to evaluate its candidacy. Results: Using the proposed approach, the Quadratic SVM model yielded an accuracy of 97.58%, surpassing the accuracies reported in the current ML literature. In addition, this model classification time was significantly smaller than that of the TL benchmark. Conclusion: The results strongly support the candidacy of the proposed approach in reliably detecting pediatric pneumonia."

We propose to eliminate the temporal domain of feature vectors by computing the mean and standard deviation of each variable across all video frames. Thus, each video is represented by a single feature vector of 67 variables. As for the motion vectors, we eliminated their temporal domain by projecting their phases using PCA, thus representing each video by a single feature vector with a length equal to the number of frames in a video. Consequently, complex classifiers such as LSTM can be avoided and classical machine learning techniques can be used instead. Experimental results on the JHMDB dataset resulted in average classification accuracies of 68.8% and 74.2% when using the projected phases of motion vectors and video coding feature variables, respectively. The advantage of the proposed solution is the use of FVs with low dimensionality and simple machine learning techniques."

    "abstract": "Video streaming stands out as the most significant traffic type consumed by mobile devices. This increased demand has been a major driver for research on bitrate adaptation algorithms. Bitrate adaptation ensures high user-perceived quality, which, in turn, correlates with higher profits for content providers and delivery systems. Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a widely adopted video streaming standard utilized by service providers to provide competitive quality of experience (QoE). It is capable of providing seamless streaming via uncertain network conditions by switching across different video qualities and their corresponding video segment bitrates. The complexity of the video streaming environment makes it a good candidate for different learning-based approaches. Accordingly, this paper proposes a reinforcement-learning (RL) deep Q-network called DQNReg, that enhances the classical deep Q-learning method. A segment-wise QoE-based reward function is formulated so that the learning strategy can converge towards maximizing the QoE outcome. The proposed RL-based adaptation approach is evaluated using trace-based simulation for both wireless local area network channels and 5G mobile channels. The performance of this RL-based method is compared to three methods: A heuristic method, a model-based method, and a classical learning-based method. The comparison shows that the RL-based method converges faster while achieving a high QoE score. In addition, it reduces the re-buffering duration while maintaining higher video quality and relatively lower quality variations."

We use these features with deep learning for model generation and classification, hence the ViCo-MoCo-DL abbreviation which stands for Video Coding and Motion Compensation with Deep Learning. These solutions are fused in terms of averaging their classification scores to predict the human activity in videos. In all proposed solutions, an input video is temporarily segmented into 12 non-overlapping segments of equal size. In the first and second solution each segment is converted into one component of an RGB image, thus resulting in 4 RGB images. The conversion happens in terms of motion capture using motion estimate, motion compensation and accumulating image prediction errors. Consequently, in the first solution, the 4 generated RGB images are tiled into one big image which is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) network. In the second solution each generated RGB image is entered into a pre-trained CNN for feature extraction. The resultant FVs are arranged into a matrix and used for training a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). In the third solution, a customized High Efficiency Video Coder (HEVC) is used to generate feature variables per frame. The resultant Feature Vectors (FVs) of 3 video segments are arranged into a matrix and numerically summarized into one FV, thus, each input video is represented by 4 FVs which are used to train another LSTM network. Experimental results on three well-known datasets show the superior classification results of the proposed fused solution over existing work."

To tackle these issues, we propose a multivariate monitoring scheme of event data that signals in real time.

Participants were asked to determine whether each video was real or fake. Behavioral analysis revealed that participants performed better in differentiating real and deepfake videos when the provided visual stimulus was in a language they were familiar with (English) and when the actor belonged to an ethnically similar background. EEG analysis demonstrated significant differences in brain signals between the three categories, suggesting the potential use of EEG as a biomarker for deepfake classification.

    "abstract": "Recognition of continuous sign language is challenging as the number of words is a sentence and their boundaries are unknown during the recognition stage. This work proposes a two-stage solution in which the number of words in a sign language sentence is predicted in the first stage. The sentence is then temporally segmented accordingly and each segment is represented in a single image using a novel solution that entails summation of frame differences using motion estimation and compensation. This results in a single image representation per sign language word referred to as a motion image. CNN transfer learning is used to convert each of these motion images into a feature vector which is used for either model generation or sign language recognition. As such, two deep learning models are generated; one for predicting the number of words per sentence and the other for recognizing the meaning of the sign language sentences. The proposed solution of predicting the number of words per sentence and thereafter segmenting the sentence into equal segments worked well. This is because each motion image can contain traces of previous or successive words. This byproduct of the proposed solution is advantageous as it puts words into context, thus justifying the excellent sign language recognition rates reported. It is shown that bidirectional LSTM layers result in the most accurate models for both stages. In the experimental results section we use an existing dataset that contains 40 sentences generated from 80 sign language words. The experiments revealed that the proposed solution resulted in a word and sentence recognition rates of 97.3% and 92.6% respectively. The percentage increase over the best results reported in the literature for the same dataset are 1.8% and 9.1% for both word and sentences recognitions respectively."

    "title": "Improved PSO With Visit Table and Multiple Direction Search Strategies for Skin Cancer Image Segmentation — Hasan Mir",
    "abstract": "Automated screening is employed to assist skin specialists in accurately detecting skin lesions at an early stage. Multilevel thresholding is a widely popular and efficient technique for enhancing the classification of skin cancer images. This paper proposes improved PSO with a novel visit table and multiple directions search strategies to develop the performance of the multilevel thresholding. A visit table strategy has been developed that prevents unnecessary searches of the original particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm by allowing the discovery of new points by making fewer visits to frequently visited points and their neighbors. Besides, a multiple directions search strategy has been introduced for the PSO to increase the diversity of the population and overcome the stuck at the local optimum by enhancing exploration ability. The qualitative, quantitative, and scalability analyzes of the improved PSO (IPSO) method were carried out on 50 benchmark functions and the highest performance was achieved with the proposed method in most of these functions. Secondly, a multilevel image segmentation application is presented on skin cancer images using two-dimensional (2D) non-local means histograms, improved PSO and Renyi's entropy. In this work, the ISIC 2017 skin cancer image dataset is used for segmentation application and various performance evaluation metrics are used. The obtained results are compared with seven state-of-the-art approaches to show the efficiency of the proposed approach. It can be noted from the obtained results that, the proposed method outperforms the compared method based on the average of evaluation metrics for all skin cancer images. The best results in SSIM value of 0.8285, FSIM value of 0.7332, and PSNR value of 19.0576 are achieved by using the proposed method in skin cancer image segmentation. Hence, our proposed method is ready to be tested with huge databases and can aid skin specialists in making an accurate diagnosis."

This paper proposes a video-based approach to recognizing Arabic sign words in the context of sentences. This is important as in real life the start and end positions of the arms are not necessarily at the sides of the signer. Rather, the position depends on the previous and successive words in the same sentence. This paper proposes to use video coding techniques to generate Sum of Displaced Differences Images (SDDI) of sign words using optical flow followed by the summation of the prediction errors of video frames. Time-dependent feature vectors are then generated from these images using transfer learning. Consequently, model generation is performed using recurrent neural networks. Experimental results performed on 80 sign language words represented in 40 sentences revealed that the proposed solution results in a word recognition rate of 98.6%, which surpasses the accuracy of existing work that uses the same sign language dataset."

    "abstract": "Wireless communication infrastructure is a key enabling technology for smart cities. This paper investigates a novel technique to enhance the performance of 5G base stations by addressing the compensation of nonlinear distortions caused by radiofrequency power amplifiers. For this purpose, a sequential digital predistortion approach that uses twin nonlinear two-box structure along with reduced sampling rates in the feedback path is proposed to implement a linearization system. Such a system is shown to have a correction bandwidth that exceeds the bandwidth of the feedback path. This is achieved by synthesizing the predistortion function in two successive characterization iterations. Both characterizations use the same hardware, which has a reduced sampling rate in the feedback path. Hence, the proposed predistorter scheme does not require any additional hardware compared to standard schemes. Moreover, coarse delay alignment is performed while identifying the memory polynomial function in order to further reduce the computational complexity of the proposed system. Experimental results using an inverse Class-F power amplifier demonstrate the ability of the proposed predistorter to achieve a correction bandwidth of 100 MHz with a feedback sampling rate as low as 25 MSa/s."

Determining the presence of various bat species in an environment is essential for many bat studies. Specialized audio sensors can be used to record bat echolocation calls that can then be used to identify bat species. However, the complexity of bat calls presents a significant challenge, necessitating expert analysis and extensive time for accurate interpretation.

This causes the utilized bandwidth to increase significantly, as seen in the 5G NR standard in which bandwidths as high as 400 MHz are utilized. Hence, the development of new predistortion techniques in which the forward and feedback paths operate at lower sampling rates is of utmost importance to realize efficient and practical predistortion solutions. In this work, a novel predistortion technique is presented by which the predistortion is divided between the digital and analog domains. The predistorter is composed of a memoryless AM/AM gain function that is implementable in the analog domain, and a nonlinear model with memory effects in the digital domain to relax the sampling rate requirements on both the forward and feedback paths. Experimental validation was carried out with a 20 MHz and a 40 MHz 5G signal, and the results indicate minimal linearization degradation with a sampling rate reduction of 50% and 30%, respectively.

This article presents a novel sensor-based HAR system that utilizes a unique feature extraction technique associated with a deep learning (DL) method for classification. One of the main contributions of this work is dividing the sensor sequences timewise into nonoverlapping 2-D segments. Then, statistical features are computed from each 2-D segment using two approaches; the first approach computes features from the raw sensor readings, while the second approach applies time-series differencing to sensor readings prior to feature calculations. Applying time-series differencing to 2-D segments helps in identifying the underlying structure and dynamics of the sensor reading across time. This work experiments with different numbers of 2-D segments of sensor reading sequences. Also, it reports results with and without the use of different components of the proposed system. Additionally, it analyses the best-performing models' complexity, comparing them with other models trained by integrating the proposed method with an existing transformer network. All of these arrangements are tested with different DL architectures supported by an attention layer to enhance the model. Four benchmark datasets are used to perform several experiments, namely, Mobile Health (mHealth), ubiquitous computing human activity dataset (USC-HAD), University of California Irvine HAR (UCI-HAR) dataset, and daily and sports activities (DSA).

The secondary base station (SBS), operating in full-duplex mode, serves as an uplink (UL) communication provider for secondary users (SUs) while actively launching a jamming signal against Eve to degrade its downlink (DL) interception capability, thus aiding the primary network. This study faces several technical challenges. First, complex interference management arises as the FD-SBS must manage interference between UL communications and active jamming signals to ensure both secure communication and minimal interference to legitimate users. Additionally, optimizing multi-dimensional beamforming across the primary base station (PBS) DL, the FD-SBS jamming, the passive RIS, and the UL communication power imposes substantial complexities due to conflicting objectives and constraints. To this end, we propose a coordinated beamforming approach, which maximizes the minimum secrecy rate with a minimum target rate for the UL SUs, a maximum DL PBS transmission power, jamming power limits and RIS unit modulus constraints. To address the problem non-convexity, it is decomposed into four sub-problems, which are solved via employing semidefinite programming (SDP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimization. Simulation results show the effectiveness of RIS phase shift optimization to enhance secrecy performance, how much jamming power is needed to keep balance between the secrecy performance and the UL communication service, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed solution against various benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has grown significantly in recent years and is now widely used by both individuals and businesses. Cloud service providers need to be prepared for failures to ensure that they can respond to them appropriately by minimizing downtime and achieving business continuity. This can be accomplished through fault tolerance mechanisms which aim to predict, prevent, and recover from failures. One of the common causes of task failures in the cloud is the deterioration of physical machines. If deterioration is detected in the physical machine, the virtual machines (VMs) being hosted must be moved to healthy physical machines. This paper proposes an approach to VM allocation in the event of host deterioration or failure. Namely, an integer linear programming optimization model is proposed for the allocation of the failing VMs while minimizing VM migration time. In addition, hybrid genetic and simulated annealing (HGA and HSA) algorithms are proposed for providing efficient solutions for the optimization model. The HGA is hybridized by a procedure that penalizes infeasible solutions to reduce their chances of being selected in the offspring populations and a hill-climbing procedure that modifies feasible solutions to produce better (or more fit) ones. The HSA starts from a feasible solution and also uses elitism as the HGA in its search to ensure that good candidate solutions are preserved. To validate the quality of the obtained solutions, we compare our approach to the commercial optimization solver CPLEX. In comparison to the CPLEX solver, the results show that for small size data center problems, the proposed HGA and HSA achieve near-optimal solutions with 70.80% and 81.43% increase in speed with an average solution quality trade-off by 20.57% and 78.52%, respectively. Notably, for medium, large and very large size problems the HGA and HSA obtained solutions where the CPLEX solver could not provide solutions within acceptable time. For medium size problems HGA attains solutions with better quality (75.82%) yet with higher execution time (57.27%). For large and very large problems HGA significantly outperforms HSA in terms of solution quality (better by 84.88% and 86.46%) yet with significantly higher execution time (74.22% and 76.55 %), respectively. Thus, the designer may choose which algorithm to use based on whether the focus is on quality or execution time."

We explored the data from the 2022 and 2023 Dakar Bike Rally to determine the most important factors to be considered in building a good race strategy. We consider the effect of teams, sponsorship, experience, the different stages and their conditions on the final rankings. To do so, we use unsupervised clustering on the times series from the different rally stages. Autoencoders and statistical testing was used to determine the most important factors that determined final standings in the race. Our findings show that the initial stages were key in determining the final outcome of the rally. Moreover, teams, nationality and experience of the riders do not significantly contribute to the final race standings. In addition, sponsorship also seemed to have an effect on the finishing standing of the participants. Furthermore, stages that start after a rest day were more critical in winning the race."

    "abstract": "Video streaming has become a popular method for delivering video content over the Internet, and the number of users and video content is increasing rapidly. The user's quality of experience (QoE) is a crucial factor in the success of video streaming services, as it quantifies the user's satisfaction. The QoE is affected by the video quality, starvation instants, and quality switching. To maximize the QoE, adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms select the video quality based on the network conditions and the client's buffer capacity. In this paper, a buffer-based ABR algorithm is proposed to maximize the user's QoE by minimizing the duration and frequency of starvation events and the time spent at the lowest quality level while maintaining smooth quality switching. A SimEvents-based scalable video coding SVC dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) system is developed to simulate the proposed algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of a baseline algorithm under different network conditions, and it is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of buffer occupancy, quality switching and video quality."

    "abstract": "Reading comprehension plays a key role in early grade literacy. During early formative years children develop crucial skills in understanding, interpreting, and critically analyzing written texts. Proficiency in reading comprehension not only enables students to extract meaning from diverse sources but also fosters cognitive abilities such as inference-making, prediction, and evaluation. Moreover, reading comprehension serves as a gateway to accessing a wealth of knowledge across various subjects. However, generating material for reading comprehension assessments at a large scale remains a challenging process. Stories used for reading comprehension often have a set of criteria that needs to be met in terms of structure and content to be able to fairly assess the abilities of the learner. Advancements in natural language processing have empowered AI models to craft narratives comparable to human-generated stories. This paper investigates qualitative characteristics within stories generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) based on Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) which is a framework designed to evaluate early literacy skills. The paper assesses qualitative indicators of these narratives using established metrics. The findings offer insights into the qualitative characteristics of narratives generated within the constraints of EGRA criteria, highlighting the capacity of AI models to produce varied and engaging stories. The paper concludes with reflections on the significance of qualitative indicators in natural language generation and suggest future research directions for enhancing AI-generated narratives' quality."

    "abstract": "Generating content for large-scale reading comprehension assessments, particularly stories, poses significant challenges including money, time, and effort. To serve as effective assessment tools, these comprehension stories must adhere to specific criteria defined in early grade reading assessment standards dictating narrative structure, character types, readability levels, and other elements. Recently Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, mainly Large Language Models (LLMs), have been used to automate the story generation process. One key challenge is ensuring diversity across the many generated stories. For example, the Early reading standards such as Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) requires comprehension stories to be similar in difficulty level but narratively different across multiple implementations to ensure fairness. This paper proposes a solution to increase diversity across stories by employing GPT-4 to generate children's reading comprehension stories mediated by a database of classic tales. By leveraging existing narratives, this method drastically reduces the resources required for content creation while ensuring alignment with the EGRA criteria. We present a systematic framework for selecting, adapting, and evaluating the stories, aiming to streamline the content generation process. The generated stories are additionally evaluated using well-defined text metrics and by a human evaluator for reliability. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating GPT-4 with classic tales to optimize resources and enhance scalability in literacy assessment practices, offering practical implications for educators and policymakers in early grade learning."

While tools have been developed to identify defects in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 presents new opportunities for enhancing requirements quality. However, the potential of LLMs in this realm remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of large-scale industrial documents. To bridge this gap, we investigate the efficacy of zero-shot GPT-4 in various requirements analysis tasks using an industrial software specification document. Our study evaluates LLM performance in detecting defects, such as ambiguities, inconsistencies, and incompleteness, while also analyzing GPT-4's ability to identify issues across version iterations and support technical experts in requirements analysis. Qualitatively, we identify key limitations of LLMs in defect detection, notably their inability to cross-reference throughout the document and their constrained understanding of specialized contexts. Quantitatively, we find that while LLMs excel in identifying incomplete requirements (precision 0.61), their performance is less impressive in detecting inconsistencies (precision 0.43) and ambiguities (precision 0.39). Although GPT-4 demonstrates promise in automating early defect detection across versions and providing accurate technical answers, our results underscore that they cannot entirely replace human analysts due to their lack of nuanced domain knowledge in a zero-shot setting. Nevertheless, avenues like few-shot learning and complex prompt design offer the potential to enhance LLM precision in defect detection."

    "title": "ATTention Please! An Investigation of the App Tracking Transparency Permission — Reham Mohamed",
    "abstract": "Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework in iOS 14.5. The goal of this framework is to mitigate user concerns about how their privacy-sensitive data is used for targeted advertising. Through this framework, the OS generates an ATT alert to request user permission for tracking. While this alert includes developer-controlled alert text, Apple mandates this text adheres to specific guidelines to prevent users from being coerced into unwillingly granting the ATT permission for tracking. However, to improve apps' monetization, developers may incorporate dark patterns in the ATT alerts to deceive users into granting the permission. To understand the prevalence and characteristics of such dark patterns, we first study Apple's alert guidelines and identify four patterns that violate standards. We then develop ATTCLS, an ATT alert classification framework that combines contrastive learning for language modeling with a fully connected neural network for multi-label alert pattern classification. Finally, by applying ATTCLS to 4, 000 iOS apps, we reveal that 59% of the alerts use four dark patterns that either mislead users, incentivize tracking, include confusing terms, or omit the purpose of the ATT permission. We then conduct a user study with 114 participants to examine users' understanding of ATT and how different alert patterns can influence their perception. This study reveals that ATT alerts used by current apps often deceive or confuse users. For instance, users can be misled into believing that granting the ATT permission guarantees better app features or that denying it protects all of their sensitive data. We envision that our developed tools and empirical results will aid mobile platforms to refine guidelines, introduce a strict vetting process, and better design privacy-related prompts for users."

This work pioneers a novel paradigm: machine learning (ML) frameworks for analysis of all three aspects using individual and merged datasets. Moreover, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are exploited to enhance result interpretability which has not been previously explored in this field. The purpose of this work is two-fold: 1) date fruit bunch type and ripeness classification; 2) classification of healthy and three stages of white-scale disease (WSD) infested date palm leaflets. For this purpose, we utilize deep learning (DL) models by adding additional layers and optimizing various parameters to enhance their performance for these specific tasks. Two publicly available datasets are used for both type and ripeness classification: Dataset 1 contains 8079 images, and Dataset 2 contains 9092 images of date fruit bunches. Furthermore, dataset 3 with 2161 images is used for healthy and WSD infestation stage identification. For individual datasets, the best performing model, VGG16, achieved the highest accuracy for date type classification (98%) and ripeness classification (93%), using dataset 1. The best performing classifier architecture on merged dataset, VGG16, achieved an accuracy of 97% and 94% for date fruit type and ripeness classification, respectively. The highest accuracy achieved for healthy and WSD classification was 99.7% using VGG16. These results were explained using several XAI techniques which were found to be useful in enhancing the models’ interpretability. Through this work, precision agriculture in the date palm sector stands to benefit from informed decision-making, optimized resource allocation, and the adoption of sustainable practices.

Some approaches rely on analyzing system calls made via processes to detect malicious behavior, while other methods focus on the affected files by creating a file integrity monitor to detect rapid and abnormal changes in file hashes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes hashing and can accommodate large files and dynamically take into account the amount of change within each file. Mainly, our approach relies on dividing each file into partitions and then performing selective hashing on those partitions to rapidly detect encrypted partitions due to ransomware. Our new approach addresses the main weakness of a previous implementation that relies on hashing files, not file partitions. This new implementation strikes a balance between the detection time and false positives based on the partition size and the threshold of partition changes before issuing an alert."

    "abstract": "While recognition of sign language alphabets and isolated words has matured in recent years, recognition of sign language sentences, or continuous signing, is still a research topic of interest in computer vision, especially in signer independent mode of recognition. Existing state-of-the-art solutions in the continuous Arabic Sign Language Recognition (ArSLR) are promising; however, when implemented in signer independent mode, the accuracies drop noticeably. In this paper, we propose a solution for recognizing continuous Arabic signing in signer dependent and independent modes through the use of motion images with positioning information. Initially, sign videos are converted into several motion images, each emphasizing a different segment of the sentence. This is achieved by a weighted sum of residual images after applying optical flow and motion compensation. Each motion image is composed of the whole sentence video, hence putting the emphasized segment into context in terms of previous and successive sign words. Thereafter, hand-crafted features are calculated from each resultant image, including numerical summaries of the horizontal, vertical and diagonal profiles. With such features, the architecture used for model generation and testing is simplified, where it consists of a single Bi-LSTM layer followed by dropout, softmax, and classification layers. This paper makes use of a recent Arabic Sign Language dataset known as ArabSign. The dataset is composed of 6 signers and 93 words arranged into 50 sentences with 30 repetitions each. Experimental results revealed that the proposed solution is suitable for signer dependent and signer independent modes of continuous sign language recognition. Using a Leave-One-Signer-Out policy, the proposed solution achieved word-recognition rates of 99.8% and 75.3%, respectively. These results noticeably surpass relevant state-of-the-art solutions."

To evaluate our proposed methodology, we conducted training and testing on the Metasploitable platform.

Those solutions only require the general MCUs features thus demonstrating board generalization across various networks and devices. These techniques come at no additional cost. It improve the inference latency without any compromise of the model accuracy or the model size.

    "abstract": "Malware, or malicious software, poses a significant threat to systems and networks. Malware attacks are becoming extremely sophisticated, and the ability to detect and prevent them is becoming more challenging. Detecting and preventing malware is crucial for several reasons, including the security of personal information, data loss and tampering, system disruptions, financial losses, and reputation damage. This paper presents a machine learning approach for Android malware detection. In this work, several machine learning algorithms were utilized, namely k-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and other ensemble classifiers including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and CatBoost. It was found that SVM using radial basis function (RBF) kernel achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 99.5%. This work proved the feasibility of using machine learning in detecting malware and improving the security of mobile devices.

In response, we present a tailored Intrusion Detection System (IDS) optimized for IoMT environments, designed to operate within the constraints of resource-limited devices while addressing complex, real-world attack vectors. Leveraging the CICIoMT2024 dataset and advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost, our approach overcomes severe class imbalance and high dimensionality. Using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), we reduced the feature set by 44.45%, achieving a state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 99.48%. Despite the superior performance of the Random Forest model, its large memory footprint poses challenges for deployment on IoMT devices with limited resources. In contrast, the XGBoost model offers a better balance between high detection accuracy and resource consumption, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Our solution offers a scalable, efficient, and deployable IDS that brings a new level of adaptability and precision to IoMT cybersecurity, ready to defend against today’s threats while evolving to meet tomorrow’s challenges."

    "abstract": "Adaptive streaming over HTTP aims to maximize user Quality-of-Experience through video quality adaptation. Conventional adaptation schemes measure the video quality for variable bitrate (VBR) video in terms of the average bitrate. However, video bitrate is not an accurate measure of perceptual quality. Alternative quality measures, such as the Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), can be used to better represent the quality perceived by the viewer. Studying the VMAF of video chunks across the same bitrate level shows that user QoE depends not only on the overall video quality, but also on the content complexity. This work proposes a deep Q-learning (DQL) adaptation algorithm that accounts for content complexity by prioritizing complex video chunks during bitrate selection. Simulation results show that the average video quality is improved by using complexity-aware streaming over the baseline algorithms,"

Some of these mechanisms include encoding bitrate adaptation and frame prefetching. However, the impact of head of line (HOL) blocking on QoE has not been extensively examined in earlier studies.

Due to potential blockage or the fact that the users might be located outside of the coverage of the terrestrial base station (TBS), there might not be a direct service link from the TBS to the users. Hence, with the use of the reflected signals from the HAPS-mounted IRS, the TBS is able to provide services to its associated user equipment (UEs). With this proposed scenario, the coverage area can be substantially increased as the HAPS are usually located in high altitudes. We study the outage performance of the proposed system taking into account the UEs distribution in the service area. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the outage probability under a Rician-faded TBS-HAPS link and a shadowed Rician-faded HAPS-UEs link. Moreover, we validate our derived expression through Monte Carlo simulations considering the effect of different system parameters on the outage probability. Results show that the proposed system can achieve outage probability in the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> up to a service area diameter of 30 km and in the order of 10<sup>-2</sup> for service areas in the range of 40 km in diameter."

Using such technologies has revolutionized ecological research and wildlife monitoring, enabling non-invasive study of animal movement, behavior, and population dynamics. However, the manual analysis and classification of the vast number of camera trap images can be time-consuming and challenging for researchers. The image data from these cameras is also naturally class unbalanced because some species are rarer than others, and typically more than half the images are 'ghost' images triggered by anomalous events like the wind. Neural networks using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm have been used to classify camera trap images. Since the deployment context of each camera trap is unique, there is a need to custom-train the classification model for each camera on the edge. Unlike BP, the newly proposed Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm reduces the memory needs for training on the edge. This paper explores how well the FF algorithms could distinguish between 'ghost' and 'animal' images for camera trap images when trained on the edge. FF algorithm on different image sizes and varying the number of neurons in each layer is investigated. The primary conclusion is that both BP and FF have similar performance and inference time on this task. In addition, FF is slower to train but requires 60% less memory than BP while training."

    "abstract": "Highlights: What are the main findings? Using machine learning was found to be effective in identifying and classifying multi-step network intrusion cyberattacks. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was identified as the top-performing machine learning model due to its high accuracy and computational efficiency, making it an ideal choice for an edge-based intrusion detection system (IDS). What is the implication of the main finding? Identifying and classifying multi-step cyberattacks through advanced IDS help protect smart cities’ systems from unauthorized access, ensuring the stability, security, and reliability of essential services. Given the dynamic nature of smart cities, where multiple systems work in tandem and data flow in real-time, this research highlights the importance of developing real-time intrusion detection systems that are able to detect intrusions as soon as they arise, enabling quick actions to isolate and mitigate risks before they can cause widespread damage. Intrusion detection systems are essential for detecting network cyberattacks. As the sophistication of cyberattacks increases, it is critical that defense technologies adapt to counter them. Multi-step attacks, which need several correlated intrusion operations to reach the desired target, are a rising trend in the cybersecurity field. System administrators are responsible for recreating whole attack scenarios and developing improved intrusion detection systems since the systems at present are still designed to generate alerts for only single attacks with little to no correlation. This paper proposes a machine learning approach to identify and classify multi-step network intrusion attacks, with particular relevance to smart cities, where interconnected systems are highly vulnerable to cyber threats. Smart cities rely on these systems seamlessly functioning with one another, and any successful cyberattack could have devastating effects, including large-scale data theft. In such a context, the proposed machine learning model offers a robust solution for detecting and mitigating multi-step cyberattacks in these critical environments. Several machine learning algorithms are considered, namely Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Random Forest (RF). These models are trained on the Multi-Step Cyber-Attack Dataset (MSCAD), a recent dataset that is highly representative of real-world multi-step cyberattack scenarios, which increases the accuracy and efficiency of such systems. The experimental results show that the best performing model was XGB, which achieved a testing accuracy of 100% and an F1 Score of 88%. The proposed model is computationally efficient and easy to deploy, which ensures a fast, sustainable and low power-consuming intrusion detection system at the cutting edge."

The discontinuation of the conventional index previously employed to detect Pi2 pulsations has driven this study to propose an innovative detection method leveraging machine learning (ML). This paper introduces a novel ML-based classification framework that utilizes geomagnetic field data for Pi2 pulsation detection. A comprehensive analysis of various linear, ensemble, and non-linear ML models was conducted, employing hyperparameter optimization to identify the optimal model with high classification performance and minimal computational overhead during testing. Model robustness was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, kappa score, execution time, precision-recall curves, ROC curves, learning curves, and confusion matrices.

These patterns point out manufacturing faults that can lead to significant internal and external failure costs unless treated promptly. Thus, detecting such abnormalities is of utmost importance. Machine learning algorithms have been widely applied to this problem. Nevertheless, the existing control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) method can only deal with a fixed input size rather than dealing with different input sizes according to the actual production needs. In order to tackle this problem, an original CCPR method relying on convolutional neural network (CNN) named as VIS-CNN is proposed. Signal resizing is performed using resampling methods, then CNN is used to extract the abnormal patterns in the dataset. Five different input sizes are generated for model training and testing. The optimal hyperparameters, as well as the best structure of the used CNN are obtained using Bayesian Optimization. Simulation results show that the correct recognition rate of the VIS-CNN is 99.78%, based on different window size control charts.

Most techniques, however, use balanced benchmarking datasets such as CIFAR and SVHN and therefore do not translate into real life applications, many of which involve highly imbalanced datasets. An investigation was conducted into the performance of the FixMatch algorithm when trained on unbalanced benchmarking datasets and a real world dataset. Three different entropy-based distributions of imbalance, with the proportion of labeled samples varied from 80% to 40%, were applied and compared to a baseline which was computed on uniformly balanced data. An increase in error rate is noted for the imbalanced datasets with larger errors seen in cases where there are a greater number of minority classes. Indeed, the distribution containing the most minority classes showed the maximum drop in performance with a mean error rate increase of 12.67% compared to the uniform baseline."

Nevertheless, as with any meta-heuristic algorithm and according to the 'No Free Lunch' theorem, SFS may suffer from immature convergence and local minima trap. Thus, to address these issues, a popular Differential Evolution variant called Success-History based Adaptive Differential Evolution (SHADE) is used to enhance SFS performance in a unique three-phase hybrid framework. Moreover, a local search is also incorporated into the proposed framework to refine the quality of the generated solution and accelerate the hybrid algorithm convergence speed. The proposed hybrid algorithm, namely eMpSDE, is tested against a diverse set of varying complexity optimization problems, consisting of well-known standard unconstrained unimodal and multimodal test functions and some constrained engineering design problems.

The proposed predistorter was trained while ensuring that it captures the full intrinsic behavior of the device under test including its memory effects and nonlinear distortions. For this purpose, the device under test was characterized while operating at peak power level with a test signal that emulates strong memory effects. Extensive experimental validation carried on a commercial Gallium Nitride power amplifier prototype demonstrated the ability of the proposed predistorter to maintain standard compliant adjacent channel leakage ratio over a wide range of operating conditions including operating average power, signal bandwidth, and carriers' configurations. It has been shown that a digital predistorter (DPD) derived from one single training condition was able to linearize the device under test for 72 different test conditions with signal bandwidths between 10MHz and 40MHz, and an operating power range of 5dB. Furthermore, benchmarking results showed that the BiLSTM DPD is unable to maintain satisfactory performance when trained with a sub-optimal signal which does not emulate the full behavior of the device under test. Moreover, it has been shown that the use of the optimal characterization signal along with a generalized memory polynomial predistorter does not lead to satisfactory performance. Hence, the resilience of the predistorter is obtained by combining the suitable model structure along with the appropriate training approach. Such resilient DPD presents a paradigm shift in predistortion techniques which significantly minimizes the need for update. It is anticipated that this work will pave the road for a new generation of DPDs resilient to a wide range of operating conditions."

However, such DL models require labeled training data. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised learning of scheduling. More specifically, this paper proposes using a Density-Based anti-Clustering for Scheduling D2D Communications (DBSCHedule). The proposed algorithm is a two-step approach that consists of clustering and anti-clustering. First, clustering aims at identifying the non-interfering groups of D2D pairs. Then, anti-clustering aims at identifying the maximally separated sub-groups to minimize the interference. The clustering step uses a fully-automated unsupervised density-based spectral-clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and the anti-clustering uses the inverse of the objective function of the k-means clustering. Results show comparable performance with the optimal FPLinQ scheduler yet without requiring any channel information nor is there a requirement to solve a complex optimization problem. Moreover, a comparable performance to the previous attempts using DL and modified clustering is achieved while being completely adaptive and easily accommodating to changes in the network layout."

Ground motion duration plays a vital role in structural response during an earthquake. Even a small magnitude event may cause severe structural damage if the duration of the earthquake is long. Thus, accurate estimation of ground motion duration is essential for structural seismic design and analysis. This article uses machine learning techniques to estimate ground motion duration for the New Zealand region. This paper investigates the use of emerging machine learning algorithms to address this critical issue using data from the New Zealand earthquakes database. The utility of the prediction models is also evaluated using numerous parameters related to filtering frequencies, fault dimensions, S-wave triggering flag, etc., apart from the traditional source, path, and site. Other parameters, e.g., the usable frequency range and the uncertainty of the available parameters, are also considered in evaluating the prediction of the considered machine learning models. Root mean squared error, along with the coefficient of determination (R2), is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The method with the least difference between actual and predicted values on the test set is presented for each duration metric available within the New Zealand database. Most importantly, the game theory-based SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are provided as to whether each independent variable would push the predictions toward higher or lower values. These explanations demonstrate the relative importance of the parameters within the strong motion database in the prediction of earthquake duration."

The MLF model was developed and tested using simulated data generated from VISSIM traffic simulation software. The optimized hyperparameters include the number of hidden layers, the size of hidden layers, the learning rate, momentum, error epsilon, and training cycles. To reduce computational time, a stepwise approach was adopted to optimize these hyperparameters. The model's performance was evaluated based on the Fscore, which is the harmonic mean of the recall and precision metrics. This evaluation metric was used because the AID is an imbalanced binary classification problem, where normal instances are the majority class and incident instances are the minority class. The results showed that optimizing the hyperparameters of the MLF model resulted in a 0.79% improvement in the F-score of the model and a 0.32% improvement in the overall accuracy of the model. The near-optimal hyperparameters for the MLF model were determined to be 1 hidden layer with 35 neurons, a learning rate of 0.015, momentum of 0.9, an error epsilon of 1.00E-10, and 1000 training cycles. The study provides insights into optimizing the hyperparameters of ANNs for AID applications in traffic management systems, which can help improve the performance of such systems.

Firstly, random projection (RP) is used to create various dimensional data and find membership matrices via fuzzy c-means (FCM). Secondly, fuzzy partitions of random projections are ranked using entropy-based local weighting along with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect any uncertainty. Then it used to evaluate the weight of each cluster. Finally, we create regularized graphs from these membership matrices and use spectral matrices to estimate the affinity matrices of these graphs using fuzzy KL divergence anchor graphs. Subsequently, obtaining the final clustering results is considered as an optimization problem, and the ensemble clustering results are obtained.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for predicting the behavior of buckling restrained braces (BRBs) using long short-term memory (LSTM) and residual neural network (ResNet) models. Nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) usually requires 3D modeling of complex parts and assigning various material and simulation properties before conducting the analysis, which can be time-consuming and computationally costly. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for modeling sequential data, such as time series, and ResNet is a discriminative deep learning-based model that can handle deeper architectures without the issue of vanishing gradient. Developing a general LSTM model requires a comprehensive database for training, cross-validation, and blind testing. Even if such a database were available, concatenating data from different BRB specimens would not be feasible when modeling a data series. Such a method would intertwine the features of the individual specimens, rendering the data useless for machine-learning purposes. On the other hand, a well-trained LSTM can predict cyclic behavior for specimens that resemble the training data. As such, a group of well-trained models can produce superior predictions when used on individually familiar data. Hence, there is a need for a prescreening classification stage. The framework presented herein utilizes an AI classifier (ResNet) that automatically recognizes the BRB specimen type of the input data and directs it to the appropriate LSTM model for prediction. The presented framework demonstrates excellent predictions with an accuracy greater than 99%. It is customizable, adaptable, and scalable to include different BRB specimens. The input data consisted of the displacement of the BRB specimens based on the AISC 341–10 qualification recommendations, while the output was the corresponding force (hysteretic response to cyclic loading). The proposed framework can be valuable in earthquake engineering applications as it demonstrates superior predictions."

In the specific case of COVID-19, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) has undertaken many initiatives, such as surveillance and contact tracing by introducing mobile apps such as Al Hosn, containment of spread by limiting the gathering of people, online schooling and remote work, sanitation drives, and closure of public places. The aim of this paper is to predict the trends occurring in pandemic outbreak, with COVID-19 in the UAE being a specific case study to investigate. In this paper, a predictive modeling approach is proposed to predict the future number of cases based on the recorded history, taking into consideration the enforced policies and provided vaccinations. Machine learning models such as LASSO Regression and Exponential Smoothing, and deep learning models such as LSTM, LSTM-AE, and bi-directional LSTM-AE, are utilized. The dataset used is publicly available from the UAE government, Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre (FCSC) and consists of several attributes, such as the numbers of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations. An additional categorical attribute is manually added to the dataset describing whether an event has taken place, such as a national holiday or a sanitization drive, to study the effect of such events on the pandemic trends. Experimental results showed that the Univariate LSTM model with an input of a five-day history of Confirmed Cases achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 275.85, surpassing the current state of the art related to the UAE by over 30%. It was also found that the bi-directional LSTMs performed relatively well. The approach proposed in the paper can be applied to monitor similar infectious disease outbreaks and thus contribute to strengthening the authorities’ preparedness for future pandemics."

    "title": "LSTM-based deep learning model for alkali activated binder mix design of clay soils — Ahmed Maged",
    "abstract": "Alkali-activated binders have been extensively studied for ground improvement, particularly in cohesive soils. However, the adoption of this method in practice is often hindered by the complex mix design process, owing to the multitude of factors influencing the compressive strength of the treated soil. The mechanical performance of the AAB-treated soil mix is not solely governed by the binder properties but is also significantly affected by the inherent soil properties, which can vary widely across different locations. This study explores the development and optimization of deep learning (DL) models for the design of alkali-activated binder (AAB) treated clay mixtures. Leveraging a large dataset of experimental test records, several DL techniques, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were utilized to predict the unconfined compressive strength of AAB-treated clay based on various input parameters. Among all the models evaluated, LSTM provided the highest predictive accuracy with a determination coefficient, root means square error, and mean absolute error of 75.8%, 0.696, and 0.412, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed soil plasticity and alkali activator-to-binder ratio as the most significant parameters affecting AAB-treated clay compressive strength. The study concludes that the LSTM model developed can serve as a practical tool for designing AAB-treated clay mixes and understanding the key factors influencing their compressive strength."

This approach minimises the sensitivity to variation in lift-off distance between the used eddy current coils and tested samples while capturing the actual conductivity profile with accuracy. This investigation further explores the potential integration of AECC spectroscopy with emerging machine learning (ML) capabilities in a theoretical-based supervised learning approach using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The complex spatial integral transform of the eddy current signal effectively filters out the information related to abrupt changes in the conductivity profile of step-like multi-layer structures, which renders the application of ANNs unfeasible for such structures. However, in the case of rectangular conductivity profiles covered in this study, it not only demonstrates the accuracy in estimating AECC spectrums over a range of different coating and substrate conductivity combinations and their associated coating thicknesses but also the retrieval of these unknown input parameters from measured AECC spectrums. The implementation of the ANN inverse model to experimentally measured AECC spectrums resulted in a maximum uncertainty of 3.37% in the conductive layer thickness estimation within a practical lift-off range."

While existing decision-making tools emphasize environmental and economic factors, the social dimension remains largely overlooked, creating a significant gap in both research and practice. To address this, the study develops a decision support tool (DST) to help construction organizations prioritize strategic investments that enhance employee social sustainability. The tool is based on a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making framework, combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Fuzzy MOORA to integrate both quantitative and qualitative assessments. A literature review, along with findings from a previous empirical study, identified 27 validated criteria, grouped into seven core sustainability alternatives. Additionally, five decision criteria (cost, risk, compatibility, return on investment, and difficulty) were refined through expert interviews. The DST was implemented as a modular Excel-based tool allowing users to input data, conduct pairwise comparisons, evaluate alternatives using linguistic scales, and generate a final ranking through defuzzification. A case study in a private construction company showed Training and Development and Work Environment as top priorities. An online expert focus group confirmed the DST’s clarity, usability, and strategic relevance. By addressing the often-neglected social pillar of sustainability, this tool offers a practical and transparent framework to support decision-making, ultimately enhancing employee well-being and organizational performance in the construction sector."

Globally, women constitute a minority within engineering programs-commonly between 20% and 30% of total enrollments-while their progression into leadership and industry roles remains comparatively low. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), government-driven initiatives and cultural shifts have accelerated women's engagement in engineering disciplines. Female engineering enrollment in many UAE universities is on an upward trajectory, in some cases approaching or surpassing international averages. Despite this encouraging trend, challenges persist, including underrepresentation in advanced research roles and slower progression into senior industry positions. Against this broader landscape, the American University of Sharjah (AUS) demonstrates a notable increase in female student intake and sustained engagement in its engineering programs. AUS's targeted recruitment efforts, supportive campus environment, and mentorship opportunities contribute to higher female retention rates and promising career trajectories postgraduation.

The outbreak of COVID-19 however, has shifted the academic community into new landscapes that require educators and students to adapt and manage their expectations. Although literature reports on research attempts to study the implications of Covid-19 on the Higher Education curricular, little has been reported on its impact on Engineering Education. This paper therefore uses the theory of Emergency Management Life Cycle (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recover) as a lens to examine the challenges faced by students and academics and coping mechanism during the COVID period. This study adopts a mixed method approach using a case study from the College of Engineering at a Higher Education Institution in the UAE due to the sudden migration to online teaching amid COVID-19. Data is collected through interviews and surveys with both students and instructors on challenges, strategies and online delivery good practices that enhanced students’ learning experience. The results show that, Technology Supported Learning tools are capable of enhancing students’ experiential learning and associated competencies, however there were a number of pedagogical, technological and psychological challenges that faced students and instructors as a result of the sudden migration online, which are likely to play a role in the impediment of the students’ learning cycle, due to the lack of preparedness in response to the state of emergency created by Covid-19. Despite these challenges, the study found that instructors with effective communication skills and teaching style, competent use of technology, flexible, friendly and supportive attitude towards teaching, played a positive role in mitigating for the lack of preparedness in response to sudden migration online. The study also reveals that by overcoming some of the technical challenges such as slow internet connection and interruptions, lessons learnt from the sudden migration to online delivery amid COVID-19, will help create new opportunities for the use of blended learning approaches to meet the needs of the on-going COVID and future online deliveries."

The influence of technology has been steadily increasing with continuing fluctuations on the academic scene due to technological developments. In today's COVID-19 related pandemic, the use of technology has tremendously increased and has become a crucial part of academia. While online learning and teaching have been part of academia for decades and many higher academic institutions offer online education, they are often seen as supplementing teaching rather than core. At the same time, research conducted on online learning and teaching during previous decades show that challenges have long existed, and that those challenges faced by online learning are not a product of this sudden migration to online amid Covid-19, but rather an amplified version of pre-existing challenges. As such, the sudden migration to an all-online mode of delivery has had major ramifications on both faculty and students. Such effects and influences need to be examined. This study therefore uses a mixed method approach to examine the challenges faced by engineering students and faculty at a renowned higher education institution in the UAE. The findings show that while faculty are more concerned about the pedagogical challenges facing them during the online delivery, students perceive the psychological challenges to be the biggest barrier to their online learning."

    "abstract": "Detecting brain abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a vital frontier in neurological research. Therefore, accurate methods are essential for guiding neurologists in diagnosing enigmatic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and brain tumors. These methods aid in the early detection and treatment of these formidable conditions. However, traditional techniques often suffer from high computational complexity and efficiency. Additionally, existing detection models lack the ability to explain their predictions, rendering them untrustworthy for clinicians. This study presents an explainable framework for automatic brain abnormality detection in MRI images. The methodology includes a robust preprocessing pipeline that ameliorates image relevance through image thresholding, morphological operations and adaptive edge detection using the AutoCanny algorithm. AutoCanny method automatically adjusts thresholds to ensure effective edge detection across different images. Then, the MRI images are fed to efficient vision transformer model (EfficientViT) for classification. EfficientViT features a memory-efficient sandwich layout, cascaded group attention module and optimized parameter reallocation. These innovations collectively enhanced the model efficiency in terms of memory usage, computational complexity and parameter optimization. Moreover, gradient-based Shapley additive explanations is employed to explain the EfficientViT model predictions. EfficientViT achieved the highest accuracy of 99.24%, 97.1%, 99.5% and 98.87% on the AD, Tumor1, Tumor2 and merged datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed model outperformed longstanding deep learning techniques. These findings have significant implications for uncovering hidden information associated with brain abnormality as well as improving the diagnostic process and treatment planning.

Therefore, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift in the teaching approach for construction management education. To meet both industry demands and student expectations, Game-Based Learning (GBL) can substantially enhance both technical and transferable skills for digital-native students who struggle with traditional teaching methods. Although the body of knowledge recognizes GBL in general, their utilization remains limited in construction management. Moreover, there is little discussion on the design process of educational games. To address these gaps, this study adopted a unique approach to educational game design by developing a time-management strategy game about resource management in construction projects with unpredictable events. This paper presents the game design process and evaluation results of a single-player digital game called ‘Always Under Stress’ developed using the Godot game engine. The goal of the game is to introduce resource management in construction projects and its associated challenges. The design and development steps, game engine, and workflow are discussed in-depth in relation to the learning objectives. In addition, this study explains how elements of randomness in educational game design can be used to challenge students’ planning and adaptability skills. Various stakeholders (n = 31), comprising of students, professors, and industry professionals, were invited to evaluate the game across six dimensions of educational game design. Results revealed positive reception towards the developed prototype regarding educational value and critical comments regarding user experience and onboarding for beginners. The findings of this study provide invaluable guidelines, considerations and lessons learned for prospective educational game designers and researchers."

    "abstract": "In alignment with the ever-growing interest in adopting sustainable practices, this paper devises a cold supply chain (CSC) planning model that integrates the three pillars of sustainability into the decision-making process while accounting for the shift towards clean energy sources. Interrelated decisions pertaining to production-distribution strategy, backorder and inventory levels, choice of truck type, and selection of third-party logistics (3PLs) providers are jointly optimized. For global CSCs in specific, such decisions are particularly sensitive to the energy sources of the refrigerated facilities and the accompanying levels of CO2 emissions generated. As such, a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed and then solved via the weighted-sum method. In essence, the model seeks to operationalize sustainability goals by considering the rapidly evolving transition in energy sources across different regions when deciding on which 3PLs to engage in a contractual agreement with while adjusting the production and distribution strategy accordingly. The practical relevance of the model is illustrated using a case study drawn from the North American frozen food industry. The conducted trade-off analysis indicates the possibility of obtaining a drastic improvement of 86% in jobs stability levels (social measure) with a maximum cost increase of around 9% as compared to the economic measure. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that it is possible to reduce 71% of CO2 emissions while attaining 63% reduction in worker variations at the expense of only 4.47% cost increase once compared to solely optimizing the economic objective."

This aligns well with the recently imposed sustainability related targets set by many legislative authorities. In this paper, we address a realistic SC problem wherein a single vendor serves multiple retailers under a VMI partnership. In order to deter the vendor from shipping larger batches downstream, the contractual agreement stipulates an upper limit on the inventory level held at each retailer's location where the vendor is penalized upon exceeding this level. In this context, economic and environmental as well as combined models are developed, with the latter employing carbon cap and carbon tax policies. Upon exploiting the structure of the developed models, computationally-efficient exact solution algorithms are devised. The conducted numerical analysis suggest that minor operational adjustments could lead to substantial carbon footprint reduction at the expense of a slight increase in the operational cost. Based on a novel use of the Lagrange multiplier, this work provides decision makers with a useful tool that aids with the selection of the most-suited carbon policy to embrace."

The latest example is the COVID-19 pandemic that got the world into a heated race to contain by developing immunization vaccines. Many of the vaccines came into production in record time which raises questions about their side effects. Also, since vaccines are sensitive medical products, they require continuous cold supply chain monitoring and tracking. It is clear how vital it is to link any occurring side effects to their causes to determine whether it is a manufacturing problem or a supply chain management issue. Additionally, and to properly establish this link, an effective beneficiaries' registration process is required. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive system that combines vaccines cold supply chain management solution with side-effects follow-up data and individuals registration records. To achieve these goals, the technology of blockchain was selected to develop a framework for the vaccines program. Blockchain is known as the architecture behind cryptocurrencies, however, it proved its reliability and effectiveness in different use cases. Blockchain special characteristics were the reason behind adopting it to establish a blockchain-based platform for vaccines cold supply chain associated with traceable side-effects information records combined with beneficiaries registration data.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where a vendor is responsible for managing the inventory of several retailers following a VMI partnership and subject to restrictions on their maximum inventory levels. To better reflect reality, we first propose a mixed integer nonlinear programming model where the vendor and the retailers operate under different environmental legislations with distinct carbon caps. Additionally, to further reduce chain-wide costs, the developed model is extended to allow for carbon exchange among SC members. We derive structural properties for both models to devise efficient exact solution algorithms. The resulting cost savings can be shared with SC members to ensure they are not worse off under the newly proposed 'carbon cap and exchange' policy. The benefits of this enhanced collaborative scheme are illustrated through a small example involving a single vendor and five retailers. Furthermore, a one-way sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the number of retailers and the restrictiveness of the SC members' carbon caps on the performance of the two proposed models. The obtained results indicate that carbon exchange among SC members is more advantageous for a larger number of retailers. Moreover, the implementation of the new carbon policy yields higher cost reductions when there are strict constraints on the SC members' carbon emissions."

Motivated by the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach, this study addresses the complex operational and planning challenges involved in integrating transportation and electrical networks for effective EV charging. Thus, this research aims to survey the literature to identify the adopted technologies, and the application and allocation of the right mix of the technologies to better serve the seamless adoption of EVs. That problem is multifaced where transportation network requirements and the electrical grid are important to support the charging loads at the needed time. The literature survey adopts the PRISMA methodology, contributing to the existing literature by highlighting the following shortcomings: 1) the problem of allocating the charging technology is either purely viewed from a transportation or an electrical perspective, 2) there is a gap in adopting both networks’ requirements comprehensively, 3) the literature predominately focuses on a single technology either battery swapping or wireless charging, 4) introducing new technologies highlights the impact of each on both networks in terms of return of investment, traffic flows, and power grids operational conditions, 5) research direction is focused more towards operation and routing while service allocation is relatively new and has not yet been extensively explored, and 6) transportation network research focuses on a static representation of the transportation network and EV demand. This study’s main contribution, besides identifying critical gaps in the existing literature and possible future research directions, is the proposal of a novel framework that integrates multiple charging technologies.

The adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems has emerged as a viable solution for enhancing HSE management by integrating real-time monitoring, compliance tracking, and risk mitigation processes. However, the effective implementation of ERP systems in HSE applications is influenced by multiple factors, which remain insufficiently explored in existing research. This study identifies and evaluates the key factors that impact the successful deployment of ERP systems in HSE management. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to establish an initial set of factors, which were then validated through expert interviews using the content validity ratio (CVR) method. Subsequently, a survey was administered to professionals within the United Arba Emirates’s public sector to assess the significance of each factor using the relative importance index (RII) method. The findings indicate that safety-related factors, including incident frequency, fatality rates, and injury tracking, are the most critical for ERP implementation. Technology utilization, engagement and training, and incident response time also emerged as key determinants. Conversely, factors related to risk management and mitigation strategies were ranked lower in terms of impact. This study provides practical recommendations to optimize ERP integration for HSE, such as enhancing data analytics for predictive safety insights, improving mobile accessibility for real-time reporting, and strengthening training programs. By prioritizing these factors, organizations, particularly in the UAE public sector, can leverage ERP systems to foster a proactive HSE culture, enhance regulatory compliance, and improve overall safety performance.

    "abstract": "As an important means of providing medical services in developing countries and remote areas, Mobile Health Clinics (MHCs) focus on distributing medical supplies and providing basic health needs to underserved communities. We model this problem as a vehicle routing problem with multiple synchronization constraints and heterogeneous demand (VRPMSC-HD) and formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). We propose a matheuristic based on adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) combined with an intensive local search phase to solve large-scale instances on the model. We assess the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach by comparing its solutions with the solutions of the vehicle routing problem with multiple trips (VRP-MT). Interestingly, the proposed approach leads to longer total traveled distance/time when taking into account the routing of the resupply truck and the MHCs. On the other hand, the proposed approach achieves significant reduction in the latest arrival metric leading to faster completion of services and higher utilization of a fleet of MHCs. Lastly, we demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed ALNS metaheuristic in solving large-scale instances of the model."

The proposed model is benchmarked against two existing linear mathematical formulations, achieving up to 95% faster computational times while solving instances with up to 20 machines, 40 resources, and 90 operations per resource—scenarios the linear models failed to handle within reasonable computational limits. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent scalability, effectively solving more extensive and complex instances.

A mathematical model is developed which seeks to establish the optimal routing and delivery schedule minimizing the total cost comprised of transportation costs, earliness-tardiness penalties, priority violations, and vehicle idleness cost. To cater for scalability issues, two computationally-efficient heuristic approaches that guarantee the attainment of high-quality solutions within reasonable CPU time are proposed. Both heuristics possess a two-phase structure, where the first phase yields highly prudent initial solutions employing a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) in the first heuristic, and Priority-Based Ant Colony Optimization (PBACO) in the second heuristic. As for the second phase, both heuristics embrace a common Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm that explores seven different neighborhoods to improve upon the initial solutions. Numerical experiments on test instances with up to 80 customers demonstrate the superiority of both heuristics in terms of CPU time and solution quality. While GRASP exhibits a slight computational advantage for instances involving 40 or more customers, the two heuristics yield solutions that are on average 0.25% and 0.60% away from the best-found solution, respectively, across all test instances. Sensitivity analysis also reveals that vehicles’ capacities, alongside other parameters, greatly impact the routing plan and the utilization of the vehicles."

    "title": "An Evolutionary Multi-objective Approach for Coordinating Supplier-Producer Conflict in Lot Sizing — Zied Bahroun",
    "abstract": "Context. This paper deals with bilateral joint decision making in supply chains, and more specifically focuses on coordinating the decisions taken by the supplier and the producer in lot sizing. Research gap. Previous existing works in lot sizing have modeled the coordination task as a bi-level optimization problem. Unfortunately, the bi-level model causes a hierarchy between the two actors by making the leader imposing the decisions that suits his/her interests to the follower. This induces a significant conflict of interest between the two stakeholders because the leaders benefit is always greater than the follower's one. Objective. The main goal of this work is to attenuate the conflict of interest issue between both actors by proposing a multi-objective model that alleviates the hierarchy and creates a win-win situation. Method. We propose an effective multi-objective lot sizing model, called Supplier-Producer Multi-Objective Lot Sizing (SP-MOLS); that alleviates the hierarchy between the actors' objectives by assigning them the same importance degree and hence optimizing them simultaneously. The resolution of our SP-MOLS model using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), as an effective meta-heuristic search engine, provides a set of trade-off solutions, each expressing a compromise degree between the two actors: The supplier and the producer. Results. To validate our approach, we use five test problems each containing 100 instances with a planning horizon of 10 periods and we analyze the obtained trade-off solutions using the compromise degree and the gap between costs as main consensus metrics. The obtained results reveal that a small sacrifice in the leader's benefit could produce a significant improvement in the follower's one. For instance, a 10% increase of the producer's cost may generate a 42% decrease in the supplier's one. Reciprocally, a 0.4% increase of the supplier's cost may generate a 49% decrease in the producer's cost. Method algorithmic improvement. As solutions of interests for both stakeholders are usually located within the extreme regions of the Pareto front, we propose NSGA-II with Focus on Extreme Regions (NSGA-II-FER) as a new variant of NSGA-II that focuses the search in the extreme regions of the Pareto front thanks to a modified crowding measure that is adaptively managed during the evolution process. This variant has shown its ability to eliminate dominance-resistant solutions and thus to come up with better extreme regions. Based on the experimental results, NSGA-II-FER is shown to have the ability to provide the decision makers with more convergent and more diversified extreme non-dominated solutions, expressing better trade-off degrees between both actors' costs. Managerial implications. The promising results obtained by our proposal encourage decision makers' to adopt a multi-objective approach rather than a bi-level one. From our personal perspective, we recommend running the three models (the multi-objective model and the two bi-levels ones); then analyzing the solutions of all models in terms of compromise degrees and logistic costs. This would allow both actors to observe how the hierarchy incurred by the bi-level models increases conflicts, while the multi-objective one generates solutions with much improved consensus degrees. Such observations will convince the supply chain stakeholders to adopt our multi-objective approach, while keeping an eye on the bi-level models' solutions and the consensus degrees. Finally, we also recommend focusing on the extreme regions of the Pareto front since they contain rich solutions in terms of consensus. Such solutions are more convincing in the negotiation process and thus could lead to better win-win situations."

Additionally, electric vehicle (EV) users have faced challenges in charging their vehicles in public charging locations where there is a risk of COVID-19 exposure. However, a case study of EV charging behavior and its impacts during the SARS-CoV-2 is not addressed in the existing literature. This paper investigates the impacts of COVID-19 on EV charging behavior by analyzing the charging activity during the pandemic using a dataset from a public charging facility in the USA. Data visualization of charging behavior alongside significant timelines of the pandemic was utilized for analysis. Moreover, a cluster analysis using k-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models was performed to identify common groups of charging behavior based on the vehicle arrival and departure times. Although the number of vehicles using the charging station was reduced significantly due to lockdown restrictions, the charging activity started to pick up again since May 2021 due to an increase in vaccination and easing of public restrictions. However, the charging activity currently still remains around half of the activity pre-pandemic. A noticeable decline in charging session length and an increase in energy consumption can be observed as well. Clustering algorithms identified three groups of charging behavior during the pandemic and their analysis and performance comparison using internal validation measures were also presented."

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in green and environment-friendly transportation systems, Electric vehicles (EV) are gaining an increasing popularity. Nevertheless, the high deployment costs of EV charging systems along with the currently low, but increasing, penetration of EVs both slow down the investments in EV charging infrastructure. This raises concerns of range anxiety for current and prospective EV owners, for fear of running out of charge without completing their journeys or reaching a nearby charging point. Accordingly, dynamic wireless charging (DWC) solutions are introduced to enable charging EVs on the move, thereby reducing range anxiety and eliminating charging downtime. Due to their high implementation and operation costs, optimal planning of DWC infrastructure is essential to determine the most suitable locations for allocating the charging lanes. In this paper, an optimal allocation process is presented for planning the locations of DWC lanes within the city of Dubai, UAE. First, data on traffic congestion levels is collected through Google Traffic application programming interface (API) to choose a set of candidate locations for deploying the DWC lanes. An energy analysis is then conducted on the selected 19 candidates to provide recommendations on the most energy-efficient subset of locations for the deployment of DWC lanes, acknowledging the number of hours in congestion and average traveling speed at each location."

This paper presents a probabilistic model for the main variables of a PL profile (i.e., arrival rates and parking durations) employing historical data. The data is categorized into different seasons and days to model their effect on the behavior of drivers. A probabilistic Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMCS) is used to imitate the uncertainties in the EVs' arrival rates.

Unfortunately, the cosmetic industry is no exception to this despite being one of the largest supply chains in the UAE. In addition to this, organizations constantly disregard their biggest wasted asset throughout their supply chain cycles, through Excess Inventory. Once goods are not being sold for a prolonged period of time, they will be continuously handled and moved around whether it is from the factory to the warehouse or back from the customer to the warehouse without ever being sold. The goods eventually become obsolete which means more harmful waste practices to get rid of the excess goods and increased costs. Although, the factors contributing to excess inventory are widely spread, there is no rating scheme providing us with the most occurring factors to the least occurring factors, to give cosmetic organizations a benchmark of where to begin when tackling excess inventory.

Currently, the problem of scheduling home care services is not performed in an optimal way taking into account the complexities of the problem in an integrated way and thus there is substantial room for improvement as the scale of the industry increases. We address the home care planning problem by formulating a mixed integer programming model that simultaneously considers the assignment of nurses to patients, the scheduling of nurses’ workdays and the routing of nurses between patients. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem that aims to minimize healthcare-associated service and routing costs while maximizing compatibility of nurses and patients. Two approaches are developed to solve the problem, namely a branch-and-price algorithm as well as a two-stage meta-heuristic. We evaluate the performance of each solution approach, and also assess the value of integrating the assignment, scheduling and routing decisions versus solving these problems sequentially. Computational studies demonstrate that our multi-objective model can bring about savings in healthcare costs and improve the compatibility between nurses and patients. These studies also demonstrate that solutions with increased compatibility do not necessarily come at a price of increased healthcare costs. Furthermore, we show that the two approaches we develop are superior to solving the mixed integer programming model using a conventional solver."

A detailed charging request scenario is first presented to highlight the required communication between the EVs and the charging infrastructure. Description of the proposed coordination algorithm is then presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a hypothetical case study considering typical traffic flows in the UAE during early morning hours. Results reveal that the proposed EV allocation algorithm achieves an almost flattened load profile across the DWC lanes. The achieved peak-to-average energy ratio (PAER) when implementing the proposed algorithm is more than 60% lower than that obtained using shortest distance-based allocation.

During the second phase, the dynamic build-up of schedules takes place in a progressive manner through a user-induced module that utilises graphical displays capturing in real-time the impact of unforeseen events on the ongoing schedule. Extensive experiments involving450 randomly generated test instances of three different sizes are carried out to assess the performance of the scheduling tool. The flexibility of the tool is assessed by the number of possible scheduling alternatives offered to the end-user. The results unveiled a high number of scheduling possibilities ranging from 155 schedules for the small size instances to 96,202 schedules for the large size instances. The relatively low number of tardy jobs (0.79 jobs on average) clearly exemplifies the robustness and quality of the scheduling alternatives despite the high number of potentially available schedules."

    "abstract": "During transportation, prediction of the Remaining Shelf-Life (RSL) of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (FFVs) is critical for planning and quality cost estimation. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables measured environmental variables to be processed in real-time. However, there is a need for a validated, real-time computational method that translates environmental measurements to dynamic RSL estimates. Most existing generic RSL models for FFVs are qualitative, invasive, or static. This study establishes a generic RSL model for FFVs under dynamic and unplanned logistic conditions. The model is based on estimating the current rate of general decay based on the expected respiration rate of the product, and integrating the decay rate with respect to time. Its implementation is non-destructive, non-invasive, and does not require accelerated shelf-life experiments before deployment. In addition, since the original model is rather computationally intensive, a surrogate model was proposed to allow the model to be implemented in fast, real-time applications for 'Edge IoT.' Experimental validation of the model using three fresh products (strawberries, apricots, and spinach) in a domestic refrigerator resulted in a maximum deviation of 1.3 days in prediction error using the original model and 2.95 days using the surrogate model. Nonetheless, the predictions made using either the original or surrogate models were statistically sound and not significantly different from the observed shelf lives of the samples, even at the 0.01 significance level."

We propose three stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) models representing different performance measures important to food banks, namely maximizing efficiency, maximizing equity, and maximizing efficiency and equity simultaneously. To solve practical large-scale instances, we develop an original matheuristic based on adaptive large-scale neighborhood search. Using real-world data based on real-life instances, we conduct an extensive numerical experiment to assess the computational performance of our approach and derive insights relevant to food banks. The proposed matheuristic produces high-quality solutions quickly with an optimality gap never exceeding 4.11% on tested instances. We also demonstrate the performance of the three models in terms of service levels, food waste, and equity."

For the model without gaming, we derive values for the buyback price that coordinate the SC and further derive ranges for the parameters where both partners are better off profitwise as compared to the no-contract case under the Stackelberg game scenario. The numerical analysis indicates that the non-gaming model always outperforms the gaming one in terms of total SC expected profit and suggests that for higher demand uncertainties, the SC members are better off profitwise at lower values of the buyback price."

However, the behavior of EV drivers and their energy demands are unpredictable and intermittent, posing challenges for power system operators when integrating a large number of EV s. To address this issue, an efficient prediction of EV s' charging demand is crucial. In this paper, a novel hybrid ensemble feature selection SVR-based model is proposed to predict the energy demand of EV's charging stations. The proposed method consists of two main steps. Firstly, an ensemble multi-model feature selection approach using four different algorithms is developed to identify the most relevant subset of features. Subsequently, the chosen attributes are employed as input for SVR to predict EV s electricity load. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed by evaluating its performance on the energy load data of EV s at a charging station in Palo Alto, USA.

    "abstract": "To address range anxiety concerns of current and potential EV drivers, on-the-move charging of electric vehicles (EV) is introduced through the development of roadway electrification solutions, i.e., wireless charging lanes (WCLs). These lanes allow EVs to recharge their batteries and compensate for the energy consumed during their motion. Nevertheless, the high deployment and operational costs of WCLs raise concerns about their expected utilization and returns on the investment. This calls for a detailed analysis of the potential locations for WCL implementation. This work proposes a two-staged multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework that integrates the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with binary goal programming (BGP), to evaluate potential locations for WCL implementation according to geospatial, environmental, technical and economic criteria. In the first stage, the TOPSIS method is utilized to rank several alternative locations according to their geospatial, environmental and technical specifications. The alternatives with the highest ranking are then shortlisted and evaluated using a mathematical BGP model, to provide recommendations on the most optimal locations and the corresponding WCL lengths that meet budget constraints according to the economic evaluation criteria. The proposed integrated TOPSIS-BGP model offers a comprehensive decision-making approach by acknowledging diverse criteria that are otherwise difficult to integrate into a single combinatorial mathematical program. A case study of major UAE cities, namely Dubai and Sharjah, is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed framework."

Efficient Automatic Incident Detection (AID) systems are crucial for timely and accurate incident detection. This paper develops a realistic AID model using the Random Forest (RF), which is a machine learning technique. The model is trained and tested on simulated data from VISSIM traffic simulation software. The model considers the variations in four critical factors: congestion levels, incident severity, incident location, and detector distance. Comparative evaluation with existing AID models, in the literature, demonstrates the superiority of the developed model, exhibiting higher Detection Rate (DR), lower Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and lower False Alarm Rate (FAR). During training, the RF model achieved a DR of 96.97%, MTTD of 1.05 min, and FAR of 0.62%. During testing, it achieved a DR of 100%, MTTD of 1.17 min, and FAR of 0.862%. Findings indicate that detecting minor incidents during low traffic volumes is challenging. FAR decreases with the increase in Demand to Capacity ratio (D/C), while MTTD increases with D/C. Higher incident severity leads to lower MTTD values, while greater distance between an incident and upstream detector has the opposite effect. The FAR is inversely proportional to the incident’s location from the upstream detector, while being directly proportional to the distance between detectors. Larger detector spacings result in longer detection times."

These pillars, known in the business field as the ‘triple-bottom-line’, require specific indicators that can be used to measure the attainment of each pillar. There is evidence that the social equity impacts of construction projects, such as transport projects, and their distributional effects across various segments of society have traditionally been viewed as secondary or subsidiary concerns relative to their economic and environmental impacts. Recognizing the relative relegation in both academic and policy circles of social impacts and the ‘weak’ tools to identify such impacts, this research aims to employ a hybrid decision method based on the analytic network process and Delphi method to identify the major adverse impacts of highway automobiles on health and social equity in the UAE. In doing so, governments will be better positioned to mitigate adverse impacts through engineering, urban planning, technological, and other appropriate initiatives.

The proposed approach consists of several stages; the input stage determines the optimal depot location, the optimal fleet, and charging sizing while determining the charging schedules and route assignment. Subsequently, the detailed transition stage aims to minimize the net present value for purchase decisions, resulting in an optimal transition plan. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a transit system comprising four short-distance routes is examined, considering two charging modes: overnight and opportunity charging. Additionally, to display the flexibility, scalability, and adaptability of this model four long-distance routes are also examined. The results highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving electrification targets while considering the limitations of the distribution system. Furthermore, the approach ensures the continuity of service for the TA. In conclusion, this article presents a comprehensive and integrated fleet transition plan, encompassing the perspectives of TAs and electric utilities.

As a result, there is a growing need for developing effective and reliable Automatic Incident Detection (AID) systems to detect incidents as early as possible to minimize their impacts. Machine Learning models, such as Neural Networks and Random Forests, have been utilized to develop AID models. However, the performance of machine learning models is significantly determined by its hyperparameters that need to be tuned to improve its performance in detecting incidents accurately and quickly. In this study, incident and normal traffic scenarios were generated using traffic simulator data, which is used to train and test a Random Forest incident detection model. The proposed methodology uses VISSIM microsimulation software to generate a diverse dataset of incident and normal conditions scenarios. Traffic parameters such as flow rate, speed, and occupancy at upstream and downstream stations were used as input variables for the model. The Random Forest model was trained and tested through RapidMiner software with 5-fold cross validation. Model performance was enhanced through the model hyperparameters tunning. An improvement of 0.35% in the F-score and 0.15% in the overall accuracy was achieved compared to the default model parameters. Findings of this study suggest that the tunning of hyperparameters of Random Forest models is crucial for developing accurate AID systems.

Furthermore, for a better resemblance to reality, workers/machines are assumed to be multi-skilled/multi-purpose posing another dimension of complexity to the problem. The objective is to minimize project duration, cost, or other relevant criteria while accounting for the inherent resources flexibility. This paper provides a systematic review of the literature pertaining to MS-RCPSP, and an in-depth analysis of 171 papers published between 2000 and 2021 inclusive. The conducted bibliometric analysis identifies the top contributing authors, most influential papers, existing research tendencies, and thematic research topics within the field. In addition, this review highlights different aspects of the MS-RCPSP, spanning the significance of performance measures, solution approaches, application areas, and the incorporation of time constraints. While project completion time, cost, and tardiness are common performance indicators, other measures such as multi-skilled staff assignment and schedule robustness are also deemed important. Although various methods have been employed to solve the MS-RCPSP including exact and approximate approaches, the selection of the most-suited approach depends on the problem's scale, complexity, and constraints, necessitating careful consideration of each method's strengths and weaknesses. Interestingly, several studies have jointly addressed resource and time constraints in the context of MS-RCPSP, often considering tardiness, and have proposed different algorithms, models, and metaheuristics to tackle these challenges.

Moreover, determining the optimal locations for fast-charging stations (FCS) in the traffic network to ensure accessibility, convenience, and efficient resource utilization poses a significant challenge. As a result, numerous studies have investigated the optimal allocation and sizing of EV charging infrastructure. The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine how this optimization problem has been addressed in the literature over the past decade. The review aims to identify the key factors considered in the problem formulation and the optimization techniques for allocating and sizing the charging stations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA methodology for a comprehensive and unbiased approach. This review contributes to the existing literature by highlighting critical gaps and proposing a framework that can possibly bridge these gaps. The review identifies several critical gaps in current research, including: 1) Transportation-focused studies largely ignore electrical grid constraints; 2) Electrical-focused research often relies on statistically modeled EV charging demand, which may include some geographical assumptions; 3) Multidisciplinary approaches integrating both transportation and electrical networks are still in early stage; 4) Dynamic traffic flow of EVs is rarely considered; 5) Exact optimization methods largely rely on linearized or approximated models; 6) Dominance of approximate methods in transportation and electrical network modeling, primarily relying on evolutionary algorithms; and 7) Hybrid approaches are mainly utilized to solve a specific part of the problem rather than enhancing the quality of the solution. In response to these gaps, the research proposes a novel framework to integrate the transportation network and the electrical grid planning process, offering a holistic and practical solution in FCS infrastructure development."

    "title": "Air leaks fault detection in maintenance using machine learning — Mahmoud Awad",
    "abstract": "Purpose: The objective of this paper is to develop a condition-based maintenance (CBM) scheme for pneumatic cylinders. The CBM scheme will detect two common types of air leaking failure modes and identify the leaky/faulty cylinder. The successful implementation of the proposed scheme will reduce energy consumption, scrap and rework, and time to repair. Design/methodology/approach: Effective implementation of maintenance is important to reduce operation cost, improve productivity and enhance quality performance at the same time. Condition-based monitoring is an effective maintenance scheme where maintenance is triggered based on the condition of the equipment monitored either real time or at certain intervals. Pneumatic air systems are commonly used in many industries for packaging, sorting and powering air tools among others. A common failure mode of pneumatic cylinders is air leaks which is difficult to detect for complex systems with many connections. The proposed method consists of monitoring the stroke speed profile of the piston inside the pneumatic cylinder using hall effect sensors. Statistical features are extracted from the speed profiles and used to develop a fault detection machine learning model. The proposed method is demonstrated using a real-life case of tea packaging machines. Findings: Based on the limited data collected, the ensemble machine learning algorithm resulted in 88.4% accuracy. The algorithm can detect failures as soon as they occur based on majority vote rule of three machine learning models. Practical implications: Early air leak detection will improve quality of packaged tea bags and provide annual savings due to time to repair and energy waste reduction. The average annual estimated savings due to the implementation of the new CBM method is $229,200 with a payback period of less than two years. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in terms of proposing a CBM for pneumatic systems air leaks using piston speed. Majority, if not all, current detection methods rely on expensive equipment such as infrared or ultrasonic sensors. This paper also contributes to the research gap of economic justification of using CBM."

Initially, we formulate a mathematical model where the retailer exclusively manages a limited fleet of its own trucks for inbound transportation of a single seasonal product. In this context, we determine a lower breakeven point for the fixed transportation cost than what has been previously proposed in the literature. Subsequently, we examine a commonly encountered transportation scenario where the retailer has the opportunity to expand its fleet size by leasing trucks from the external market. The outcomes of the numerical example indicates that the flexibility resulting from the utilization of different types of trucks can lead to reduced overall costs. We also address the practical transportation problem of efficiently shipping various seasonal products solely with the retailer’s own trucks. For this complex problem, we propose an optimal solution procedure based on Lagrangian method. We show that the joint replenishment of multiple products results in cost savings and enhances utilization of the trucks’ capacities."

This study implements HLC between two neighboring companies ordering different products from the same supplier. The study adopts the can-order policy, employing three threshold values to define each company's ordering policy and potential joint orders. To better reflect real-world operational aspects, a simulation-based optimization approach is employed, allowing experimentation with various realistic scenarios. The developed model assumes stochastic demand and lead time for both companies and assesses the benefits of HLC from both economic and environmental standpoints, one at a time. Computational experiments consistently demonstrate cost savings through collaboration, especially when both companies are similar with low unit holding costs. From an environmental standpoint, adopting the collaborative model can reduce carbon emissions by up to 27%, particularly when both companies are identical and have low demand and low products' weight. Statistical analysis using paired t-tests confirms the significant differences in cost and carbon emissions after implementing HLC."

However, before extensively using EVs, charging stations need to be planned to meet the changing needs of electric vehicles. These charging stations need to be placed at various locations so that they can serve the maximum number of EVs, without significant delays. In this paper, a procedure for optimizing the locations of EVs charging stations is presented. The proposed approach uses the simulation software DYNASMART to simulate different percentages of EVs under different traffic congestion levels. To be able simulate EVs in DYNASMART, two main components have to be coded in the software. First, a subroutine is added to simulate EVs (i.e., tracking the battery charge level). The second component considers the operations within the charging stations. Additionally, an optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the location of EVs charging stations. The problem considers predefined possible locations of the charging stations based on the electric grid system (m possible locations). The optimization procedure seeks to determine the best location for a set of (n) charging stations (n ≤ m). The objective function of this model includes two components, which are the waiting and traveling time to the charging station and it is subject to several constrain."

In order to electrify the public transportation system, the first stage is to determine the appropriate sizing of the necessary assets. Consequently, the goal of this work is the sizing of the fleet and chargers for transit agencies that choose to operate their fleets using two different modes of charging: overnight and opportunity charging. The developed methodology incorporates detailed route assignment, energy consumption modeling, and charging requirements for electric fleets. The problem goes through several stages: day-time operation is first modeled for every route individually to determine battery electric bus (BEB) route assignment while enforcing battery state of charge (SOC) constraints. Next, night-time operation is modeled to determine the optimal number of chargers needed to fully charge the fleet in preparation for the next day’s operation. Once the operational formulation is completed, the planning formulation which determines the final selection of the assets to be purchased is presented. This formulation reflects the real-world selection and procurement process, which accounts for the interactions between transit agencies and technology manufacturers or suppliers. In this work the proposed methodology is applied on a transit system comprised of four short-distance Canadian routes, to determine the final number of BEBs and chargers needed for both modes of charging. The results highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach in determining the operation of the fleet as well as the required number of chargers required."

The main objective is to minimize the total cost, achieved by minimizing the cost of the new cables connecting the depot station to the distribution system and the upgrade cost of existing lines to meet the additional loads. The outcomes are the optimal location of the depot, the optimal electric node bus in the distribution system to supply it, and the required system upgrades. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model and solved using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The methodology is tested on the H16 EB service line in Barcelona, Spain, and a typical electrical distribution system. Three case studies are presented in this paper. In the first case, the impact of a single service on the distribution network is analyzed, and in the second case, three H16 EB services are assumed to serve the network. The third case handles a multi-route, multi-terminal bus service to allocate and supply a depot capable of accommodating all the routes. This case will also include sensitivity analysis to test the robustness and reliability of the model. Results show that for a single H16 EB service, no line upgrades were needed, and the total cost per phase was $120,000. For three H16 EB services, three lines required upgrades, and the total cost per phase increased to $718,000. In the third case, the sensitivity analysis revealed that higher demand factors lead to increased costs due to more update requirements and voltage deviations. The results demonstrate that the minimum distance between the depot and node is not always the optimal or feasible solution that would prevent the depot load installation at a weak spot and meet the power flow constraints."

This paper addresses the truck selection problem under a consolidated shipment policy (TSP-CSP) by developing a mixed-integer linear programming model to identify the optimal fleet mix and size. To solve this NP-hard problem efficiently, a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach that exploits the structural properties of the model is initially proposed, followed by a more efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) metaheuristic. Computational experiments comprising 300 randomly generated test cases reveal that the GA is 15 to 30 times faster than DP, with a maximum cost deviation of less than 1%. The purely economic TSP-CSP is then extended to account for carbon emissions while employing either the carbon tax or the carbon cap policy, which are also solvable using the same DP and GA-based procedures. Lastly, a third extension incorporating inventory replenishment decisions in the context of the TSP-CSP is considered and an efficient hybridised metaheuristic approach employing GA/DP with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is developed.

    "abstract": "Highlights: What are the main findings? Both transportation and communication networks should be considered simultaneously for a successful implementation of communication network for dynamic route guidance systems. There is a need for in-depth investigation to address the scalability and robustness of comprehensive communication architecture for dynamic route guidance systems. An integrated framework that considers the transportation and communication networks is presented. What is the implication of the main finding? The proposed framework shows promise for real-life implementation of comprehensive communication network for dynamic route guidance systems. Combining the transportation and communication networks may lead to a robust and efficient communication architecture for dynamic route guidance systems. Due to its anticipated impacts on the performance of transportation systems, intelligent transport systems (ITS) have emerged as one of the most extensively investigated topics. The U.S. Department of Transportation has defined route guidance systems (RGSs) as one of the main categories within ITS. Systems like these are essential components when managing travel and transportation. While RGSs play a pivotal role in both present and future transportation, there has been limited research on evaluating the effectiveness and dependability of integrating them with vehicular communication frameworks. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the RGS architectures proposed to date in the literature, providing comparisons and classifications based on their structures and requirements for communication systems. Moreover, it explores existing, next generation, as well as prospective choices for V2X communication technologies, evaluating how well they contribute to the development of RGS applications by integrating them with potential communication systems. Specifically, this study assesses the suitability of communication technologies in meeting the requirements of RGS applications. In conclusion, it suggests a framework for integrating RGS and V2X systems and offers directions for future research in this area."

    "abstract": "As companies strive to achieve operational excellence, efficiently planning logistics activities including the scheduling of deliveries and vehicle routing has become the imperative rather than a choice. To that end, this paper addresses a practical instance of the well-known vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) that caters for the existing variation in the customers importance (through a priority index) as well as simultaneous pickup and delivery operations at different locations on a vehicle's designated route. Assuming a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, a mixed integer programming model is devised which accounts for the trade-offs between time window violations, priority costs, and transportation costs. The model is solved to optimality for small instances involving 10, 15 and 20 customers using CPLEX optimizer. Computational experiments conducted under various settings of the problem parameters reveal that more vehicles are dispatched when greater emphasis is placed on timely deliveries. Moreover, fully adhering to the customers' priorities while meeting the prescribed time windows is a challenging task and may still result in delays when both service quality measures are considered simultaneously."

A key aspect of this is efficient emergency management, which includes optimizing the routing of emergency vehicles to reduce response times. This paper introduces a mathematical model for coordinating emergency vehicle fleets, focusing on enhancing both response times and resource efficiency. The model incorporates diverse fleet routing strategies to ensure optimal vehicle dispatch in response to incidents. It takes into account factors such as vehicle availability, the urgency of supplies, multiple origin and destination points, and real-world transportation networks. By distributing vehicles across multiple paths, rather than just the shortest one, the model minimizes congestion risks and ensures that resources-especially the most critical-arrive promptly. Case studies demonstrate the model's effectiveness in scheduling and routing emergency vehicles based on truck availability and resource priority. The findings suggest that relying solely on shortest-path routing may not be suitable for large fleets."

While recent advancements have significantly extended EV driving ranges and improved charging infrastructure, operational challenges such as charging logistics and energy management for electric taxis (e-Taxis) still require careful consideration to ensure reliable service. Addressing this issue is critical for ensuring uninterrupted service and customer satisfaction in e-taxi operations. In this work, an energy-aware optimal e-taxi dispatching solution is proposed, utilizing Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning to minimize energy consumption while optimizing fleet operations. The proposed dispatching algorithm aims to reduce the frequency of e-taxi recharging, decrease customer waiting times, and lower empty taxi mileage, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of e-taxi services. The proposed algorithm demonstrated a significant reduction in the average Bellman error with an increase in the average cumulative reward across the training episodes. This confirms its effectiveness in minimizing the energy consumption of the e-taxi fleet while maximizing the covered demand."

A number of logistics providers have suggested the incorporation of drones with trucks to provide a more flexible delivery system. This paper analyzes the content of 95 publications related to hybrid truck-drone delivery systems (HTDDS) in the context of last-mile delivery. First, a brief overview of the potential implementation of drone delivery systems is presented, including their integration with other vehicles. The overview aims to demonstrate the operational characteristics of such systems and their implications. Then, the surveyed literature is classified based on vehicles roles, system configuration, problem formulation, and solution methods. In relation to this research, several key findings and potential research directions are discussed. Despite the high level of interest in HTDDS research, it is still in its early phases and requires improvements in various areas. The payload capacity, speed, range, and energy consumption are all factors that must be considered in the modeling of drone characteristics. Almost all studies identify customer requests before the delivery operation begins. However, customer demands for immediate delivery present an opportunity for real-time optimization to provide solutions for e-commerce activities. Environmental issues are developing, as the last-mile delivery problem is regarded as the most polluting portion of the supply chain. Thus, more consideration should be given to the environmental impact of HTDDS. Finally, research on drone routing related to air traffic management has received relatively little attention."

We develop a novel demand function that incorporates quality and its deterioration through three supply chain parties: producer, distributor and retailer. We use the model to analyse the impact of IoT on the retailer and distributor performance in a Stackelberg game context. The model can be used to justify IoT investment and to decide where to deploy IoT technologies in the supply chain. We find that the introduction of IoT technologies allows supply chain partners to make rational decisions that are quality-informed, reduce waste and improve revenues.

    "title": "BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR TRACEABILITY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN SEAPORTS — Vian Ahmed, Zied Bahroun",
    "abstract": "Maritime shipping plays a pivotal role in the global transportation system, providing safety and cost-effectiveness. However, it encounters numerous challenges, including port congestion, delivery delays, complex paperwork, unreliable reports on hazardous materials, and difficulties in tracing containers. To address these issues and mitigate risks associated with the transportation of hazardous goods, researchers have explored the implementation of blockchain technology in the maritime sector. Blockchain offers decentralization, transparency, and auditability of transactions, as well as the ability to trace and track cargo, particularly hazardous materials. Despite its potential, there is limited research available on the practical implementation of blockchain for hazardous material traceability. This research paper aims to investigate the application of blockchain technology in enhancing hazardous material traceability in seaports, contributing to the growing body of knowledge regarding blockchain's potential in this area and providing valuable insights for future research and practical implementations. Moreover, the paper suggests a preliminary framework for an optimized blockchain algorithm for hazardous material traceability. The main findings highlight the significant potential of blockchain technology in improving traceability of hazardous materials in seaports. Real-time tracking and monitoring of hazardous materials from origin to destination can be achieved through blockchain's distributed nature, reducing the risk of data manipulation or fraud. The immutability of blockchain records ensures the integrity and accuracy of critical data related to material composition, handling procedures, and safety certifications. Furthermore, blockchain's decentralized control allows for collaborative traceability in seaports, involving stakeholders such as port authorities, shipping companies, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers. This distributed governance model promotes shared responsibility and fosters cooperation and accountability. Implementing blockchain technology can lead to enhanced safety, security, and compliance in handling hazardous materials. The benefits include improved real-time tracking, accurate record-keeping, streamlined compliance processes, and enhanced collaboration among stakeholders."

    "abstract": "With the increasing investments in on-the-move electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions and wireless charging lanes (WCLs), coordination of the energy requirements of mobile EVs becomes essential to ensure load balancing while maximizing demand coverage. This necessitates the development of online and mobility-aware algorithms for assigning EV-to-charging lanes. In this work, a decentralized, blockchain-based EV assignment and energy allocation system is presented. The objective of system is to coordinate the charging requirements of mobile EVs among the available WCLs within a network of EV chargers in an Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEVs). This blockchain-based system offers higher security, transparency and immutability over traditional rule-based coordination schemes. It also offers an integrated end-to-end framework that handles user registration, authentication, lane activation and energy reporting. This is in addition to its main functionality of establishing a real-time and load-balanced EV-to-WCL assignment process that addresses the EV energy requirements within constraints of traveling distance and remaining EV energy. The proposed system is tested on the Ethereum blockchain and its security and transparency are both validated accordingly."

    "abstract": "Drones have recently been suggested as a means of performing last-mile deliveries, as they have several advantages compared to traditional delivery vehicles. A recent research avenue is to adopt a hybrid truck-drone delivery system that integrates drones with traditional delivery methods such as trucks. This paper deals with the problem of optimizing the delivery operation of a truck working in tandem with a drone capable of visiting multiple customers per dispatch. We also introduce practical attributes such as allowing the truck to launch and retrieve the drone from both customer and non-customer nodes as well as permitting cyclic and acyclic drone operations. An integer linear programming model is first formulated followed by the development of an effective variable neighborhood search (VNS)-based approach. The novelty of the latter is that it incorporates an effective categorisation of neighborhoods due to their large number that is needed while retaining their individual impact through an adaptive selection scheme. The performance of this powerful VNS-based heuristic is empirically assessed against three variants of the VNS. The VNS heuristic was also shown to be flexible and effective at handling the issue of synchronization. A sensitivity analysis, based on some of the critical parameters of the drone, is conducted alongside highlights of some interesting insights."

An essential component of a smart city is an intelligent transportation system where electrification of transportation is one of its pillars. Electric vehicles (EVs) rely on the electric grid and communication systems for planning, management, and operation. Instead of being seen as an additional stress on the electric system, EV charging could be thought of as a hidden opportunity due to its special characteristics. Thus, investing in smart chargers and the strategy adopted is a crucial decision. This work investigates five parking lots with diverse locations and profiles of arrival and departure of vehicles to assess their flexibility in adopting various smart EV charging strategies. Results show that some parking lots are more flexible than others in terms of peak load and cost reduction based on their locations and profiles."

    "abstract": "The use of drones in last-mile delivery services has attained significant interest due to the need for fast delivery. In addition, drones have the potential to reduce the cost associated with last-mile deliveries. However, restrictions such as payload capacity, range limits, and legal regulations have restricted the effective operational range of drones. To assist in alleviating these operational limitations, integrating a conventional delivery truck with drones to form a truck-drone delivery system, has received significant attention in the literature. This paper presents a scenario in which a single drone works in tandem with a single truck to serve customers. The drone can perform multiple deliveries in a single route, and the objective is to minimize the total traveling costs of both vehicles. An integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed and solved to optimality for small instances using the exact solution method. Considering the complexity of the ILP model, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is introduced and assessed using small and large instances. In addition, a modified VNS algorithm involving a new neighborhood selection strategy is proposed and compared to the basic VNS. Both algorithms generate solutions in a short computational time for instances with up to 100 customer nodes."

However, drones face limitations including short endurance, small payload capacity, and susceptibility to interference. Therefore, the cooperative delivery model integrating drones with existing transportation modes holds both theoretical research significance and practical application value. This literature review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical discussions on routing algorithms and practical implementation strategies for efficient delivery using drones in collaboration with trucks, public transportation, and electric vehicles (EVs), While existing literature predominantly focuses optimal UAV routing algorithms, little research addresses the potential challenges faced during the practical implementation of integrated drone-ground transportation systems. Addressing these gaps is crucial for maximizing the potential of delivery drones within a sustainable logistics ecosystem. This review explores key areas including current UAV battery charging techniques, types of delivery drones, and the integration between drones and trucks, public transportation systems, and EVs for last-mile delivery (LMD) tasks. By addressing these critical aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating drones into the existing transportation infrastructure, ultimately enhancing delivery efficiency."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being deployed as one of the vital elements for the future of transportation services. Automated vehicle technology is developing rapidly, and this prompted researchers to further assess their impacts on transportation networks. One of the most critical situations when deploying AVs is the mixed traffic conditions. This situation will be faced when the deployment is not full (i.e., the percentage of AVs in the traffic flow (market share) is not 100% yet). Therefore, there will be an interaction between AVs and regular vehicles (RVs). This research aims to evaluate the implications of AVs on freeway traffic safety. This investigation considered the section of the road of E311 (Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Road) freeway in Dubai, UAE as the test corridor for the study. Microsimulation software (PTV VISSIM) is used to simulate and assess different traffic scenarios. The developed model aimed to forecast potential traffic accidents on the freeway. In this experiment, a total of 7 demand-to-capacity (D/C) ratios and 10 market share values are considered. The findings indicate that the integration of AVs significantly reduces the frequency of potential traffic accidents. Notably, the largest reductions in accident rates, ranging from 70% to 100%, occur when AVs comprise between 40% to 100% of the traffic. Moreover, the results suggest that complete elimination of potential traffic accidents is achievable with full AV deployment, thereby removing human-driven vehicles from the freeway. This research underscores the substantial safety benefits that AVs could deliver as their presence in traffic flows increases, highlighting their crucial role in enhancing freeway safety."

Coastal development in the region, including construction, reclamation, shipping, wastewater discharge, and tourism growth, has negatively impacted oyster habitats. The objective of this study was to analyze the impacts of coastal urban development on probable oyster habitats from 2018 to 2023 in Northern UAE (Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al Quwain) using atmospherically corrected satellite imagery collected from Sentinel 2A/B. To map the oyster locations, the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) alongside water body mapping techniques was used, while a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was adopted to visualize growth patterns in coastal urban areas. Our results show that the oyster habitat declined from the initial maximum of 10.30 km<sup>2</sup> in 2018 to a minimum of 3.02 km<sup>2</sup> in 2023, while urban areas concurrently increased over this period from 275 km<sup>2</sup> in 2018 to 475 km<sup>2</sup> in 2023. There was a significant negative correlation between coastal urban area and the oyster habitat area (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80). Additionally, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify further biophysical and anthropogenic factors conducive to oyster growth. Our results show that generalized urbanization and coastal development is a persistent driver of probable oyster habitat loss and degradation in the northern UAE.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for freshwater coupled with the decline in traditional water sources is driving the increased consumption of desalinated water. This paper introduces a comprehensive mathematical model that seeks to jointly optimize a multitude of strategic and tactical decisions within desalinated water systems while accounting for environmental alongside economic considerations. These decisions include the installation of new desalination plants, replacement of obsolete units, selection of desalination technologies, and the expansion of existing facilities as well as the location of new ones. Additionally, the model determines annual production levels in each plant, allocates water to various demand zones, and manages water levels in storage tanks. In order to validate the model, a realistic case study drawn from the United Arab Emirates is utilized. It is found that the operational cost components of desalination, transportation pipelines, and storage facilities are more significant than their capital cost counterparts. In addition, all replaced and new units employed Reverse Osmosis technology, which is in line with the emerging trend worldwide. Finally, the effect of increasing the capacity of new units and varying the carbon emissions tax on the relevant decisions as well as the overall cost is studied as part of the sensitivity analysis."

Hence, measuring and monitoring the concentrations of these particles is essential. In this study, the main objective is to develop a remote sensing based PM10 monitoring model for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using Landsat 8 imagery. Landsat 8 images acquired during the four-year period from 2016 to 2022 were obtained and used along with PM10 data collected at 41 ground monitoring stations corresponding to the acquisition of the satellite data (data from 30 stations used for model development 11 stations were used for model testing). The Landsat 8 data was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Core Science Systems in the form of Digital Numbers (DNs). The DNs of the four optical bands of Landsat 8 were then converted to top of the atmosphere reflectance (TOA) through radiometric processing, and then used to estimate the Aerosol Optical Thickness. A spectral PM10 model was then developed through regression analysis, correlating AOT to PM10 values obtained at the ground stations. The model provided an R-squared value of 65% and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.55 µg/m3. The results suggest that the developed model is robust in estimating PM10 values and can therefore be used for satellite-based monitoring at any location in the UAE."

This study integrates hydrological modelling with high-resolution climatic and land cover datasets to estimate WY at district and watershed levels. Our results highlight significant spatial variability in water yield, with Chamoli 6.30 billion cubic meters (BCM), Pithoragarh (5.75 BCM), and Uttarkashi (5.27 BCM) exhibiting the highest district-wise yields, while Haridwar (0.95 BCM) and Udham Singh Nagar (1.01 BCM) showed the lowest. Watershed-level assessment identified Basin 1 and Basin 6 as major contributors, each generating 8.79 BCM of water yield, whereas Basin 7 demonstrated the lowest yield (0.12 BCM). LULC analysis revealed that tree cover, occupying 56.13% of the total area, contributed the highest WY (20.93 BCM), followed by grassland and cropland. Conversely, barren lands, built-up areas, and herbaceous wetlands exhibited minimal contributions. Surplus and deficit zone classification showed that approximately 24.37% of the area falls under severe water deficit, while 5.67% experiences severe water surplus, indicating pronounced hydrological imbalances. The findings highlight the utility of the Budyko Framework and GEE in large-scale hydrological assessments and their potential for improving water resource management strategies. This study provides critical insights for policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize watershed conservation, mitigate water deficits, and enhance water security in Uttarakhand. This study also highlights the importance of forest conservation and sustainable land management in maintaining hydrological balance in mountainous regions by linking LULC dynamics with water yield and has implications for local and regional water resource management."

By utilizing fluid dynamics at the microscale, these techniques offer precise control over chemical, biological, and physical processes, presenting advantages such as reduced energy consumption, miniaturization, portability, and enhanced process control. A significant challenge in scaling microfluidic desalination for macro applications is the disparity in flow rates. Current devices operate at microliters per minute, while practical applications require liters daily. Solutions involve integrating multiple units on a single chip and developing stackable chip designs. Innovative designs, such as 3D microfluidic chips, have shown promise in enhancing scalability. Fouling, particularly in seawater environments, presents another major challenge. Addressing fouling through advanced materials, including graphene and nanomaterials, is critical to improving the efficiency and longevity of devices. Advances in microfluidic device fabrication, such as photo-patterned hydrogel membranes and 3D printing, have increased device complexity and affordability. Hybrid fabrication approaches could further enhance membrane quality and efficiency. Energy consumption remains a concern, necessitating research into more energy-efficient designs and integration with renewable energy sources.

    "abstract": "Green hydrogen is a promising solution for the transition to sustainable energy, with water electrolysis serving as a key production method. The use of ultrapure water (conductivity <1 μS/cm) is critical for optimizing electrolysis efficiency. Recent advancements in membrane-based water treatment technologies have demonstrated the ability to produce highly pure water suitable for electrolysis. However, existing reviews often overlook the impact of these advancements on the electrolysis process itself. This review addresses this gap by evaluating various membrane technologies and strategies for integrating membrane processes with other technologies and renewable energy sources. Producing ultrapure water for electrolysis is a multi-stage process, where membrane and non-membrane pretreatment steps mitigate fouling, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent units, such as reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis. Techno-economic assessments reveal that hybrid membrane processes outperform single membrane processes due to lower energy consumption, reduced costs, and higher water quality (ion concentration <1 μg/L). Economic studies also highlight the benefits of integrating renewable energy to optimize power usage. This review also explores challenges in the integration of membrane technologies with renewable energy and waste thermal heat sources, which remains a significant hurdle in ultrapure water production. Recommendations for addressing these challenges and advancing membrane technologies are presented, concluding that membrane processes are highly effective yet require further innovation to overcome persistent fouling issues."

Antibiotics (such as Ciprofloxacin (CPFX) pose a serious threat to humans and to the ecosystem due to its accumulation in water sources which can lead to chronic health problems and endanger aquatic life. It is therefore crucial to properly remove them from water. In this work, a nano-composite adsorptive membrane based on Zirconium Phosphate (ZrP) adsorbent supported on Polyethersulfone (PES) was synthesized and evaluated for the removal of CPFX from synthetic aqueous solutions. The membranes described here showed a very high antibiotic removal rate. The effect of various parameters such as the initial concentration of the antibiotic, the adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and temperature was studied. The equilibrium data were found to reasonably best fit with the Temkin isotherm model. The membranes showed a high ciprofloxacin removal (99.7%) as opposed to (68%) when PES membrane alone was used. Moreover, a significant improvement in the membrane's water flux (100.84 L/m<sup>2</sup>.h) and permeability (97.62 L/m<sup>2</sup>.hr.bar) were noticed as opposed to pure PES membrane's flux and permeability.

The results confirmed the successful formation of ZrP nanoparticles adsorbent within the membrane matrix, and with enhanced hydrophilic properties.

An elevated selenium concentration in water threatens human health and aquatic life. The migration of this metalloid from the contaminated sites and the problems associated with its high releases into the water has become a major environmental concern. The mobility of this emerging metalloid in the contaminated water prompted the development of an efficient, cost-effective adsorbent for its removal. Selenite (Formula presented.) removal from aqueous solutions was studied in laboratory-scale continuous and packed-bed adsorption columns using iron-coated natural zeolite adsorbents. The proposed adsorbent combines iron oxide and natural zeolite’s ability to bind contaminants. Breakthrough curves were initially obtained under variable experimental conditions, including the change in the initial concentration of (Formula presented.), and the ionic strength of solutions. Investigating the effect of these parameters will enhance selenite mobility retardation in contaminated water. Continuous adsorption experiment findings will evaluate the efficiency of this economical and naturally-based adsorbent for selenite removal and fate in water. Multilinear and non-linear regressions approaches were utilized, yet low coefficients of determination values were respectively obtained. Then, a comparative analysis of five boosted regression tree algorithms for a selenite breakthrough curve prediction was performed. AdaBoost, Gradient boosting, (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) models were analyzed using the experimental data of the packed-bed columns. The performance of these models for the breakthrough curve prediction under different operation conditions, such as initial selenite concentration and ionic strength, was discussed. The applicability of these models was evaluated using performance metrics (i.e., Mean Absolute Error ((Formula presented.)), Root Mean Square Error ((Formula presented.)), Mean Absolute Percentage Error ((Formula presented.)), and coefficient of determination ((Formula presented.)). The (Formula presented.) model provided the best fit for a breakthrough prediction with a coefficient of determination (Formula presented.) equal to 99.57. The k-fold cross-validation technique and the statistical metrics verify this model’s accurateness. A feature importance assessment indicated that (Formula presented.) initial concentration was the most influential experimental variable, while the ionic strength had the least effect. This finding was consistent with the column transport results, which observed (Formula presented.) sorption dependency on its inlet concentration; simultaneously, the ionic strength effect was negligible. This work proposes implementing machine learning-based approaches for predicting water remediation-associated processes. The significance of this work was to provide an alternative method for investigating selenite adsorption behavior and predicting the breakthrough curves using a machine-based approach. This work also highlighted the importance of management practices of adsorption processes involved in water remediation."

    "abstract": "The accelerated growth of population and industrialization led to increased demand for clean water resources. The abundance of wastewater produced daily can often make its way into the environment without sufficient treatment. This led to a necessity in developing technologies to invest in solving this global problem. The integration of forward osmosis (FO) into microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is among the proposed technologies to solve some of the existing problems related to water treatment. Not only does this invention contribute to treating wastewater, but it also produces clean water, and generates renewable energy at a low cost. This chapter is devoted to discussing membrane transport theory, FO, MFC, and the combination of FO and MFC as osmotic microbial fuel cells (OsMFCs). Furthermore, the chapter aims at illustrating various designs and configurations of MFCs, targeting the optimization of their applications. It discusses the challenges and limitations of OsMFC and their maintenance while providing case studies on the application of OsMFCs for wastewater treatment.

This study offers an enhanced Chaotic Sobol Sequence-based Multi-Objective Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (CS-MOSADE) algorithm for multi-objective WDN design. The CS-MOSADE algorithm was tested on two benchmark WDNs, and a real WDN. Optimization results indicate that the CS-MOSADE algorithm converged two to three times faster than the MOSADE and NSGA-IIalgorithms and led to better output in terms of even distribution of solutions and convergence towards the true Pareto-optimal front. Smaller spacing metric indicated better uniformity in the obtained solutions; and larger hyper-area and coverage function values depicted better convergence towards the true Pareto-optimal front for the CS-MOSADE algorithm compared to the other algorithms. The CS-MOSADE algorithm was then applied to solve a WDN expansion problem for optimal pump scheduling and minimization of Life Cycle Cost, maximization of reliability and minimization of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. A significant reduction in GHG emissions of 2.17 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg was achieved at an additional cost of $0.55 x 10<sup>7</sup> when optimal pump scheduling was incorporated in the model of the real WDN over service life of 50 years."

    "abstract": "Climate change has become the greatest threat to the survival of the world and its ecosystem, due to the increasing problems associated with the rise in sea level, food-insecurity, natural resources scarcity, seasonal disorders. Among these problems, is the issue of water scarcity resulting from the lack of water resources and global warming which has plagued several nations and acknowledged by the United Nations (UN) as a primary resource to the development of societies under the “Water Goal” of the sustainable development goals. As such the changing climate and intermittent availability of water resources pose major challenges to forecast demand, especially in countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which has one of the highest per capita residential water consumption rates in the world. This study therefore aims to propose a water demand forecasting model as a form of criterion validity that incorporates the significant factors considering “mean temperature”, “mean rainfall”, “relative humidity”, “Gross Domestic Product (GDP)”, “Consumer Price Index (CPI)” and “population growth” as the significant factors for predicting the future water demand of the UAE. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model was adopted along with test conducted such as R 2 known as the coefficient of determination and Mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate predictive validity of the forecasting model. The measure of predictive validity indicates that the model is reliable and valid which predicts the water demand forecasting in the UAE showing that the future demand will decrease from 1821 million m3 in 2018 to 1809.9 million m3 in 2027."

The first, TOP-SA, was synthesized using trioctylphosphine (TOP) as a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and 2-hydroxy benzoic acid as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD). Among these, TOP-SA had the highest MB removal efficiency. The effects of pH, contact time, initial MB concentration, volumetric ratio, temperature, and ionic strength were studied and optimized. A 99.3% removal was achieved in 5 min for a 200 mg dm<sup>−3</sup> MB solution mixed in a 1:10 ratio with TOP-SA at 25.0 °C. The structural properties of TOP-SA and its interactions with MB were investigated using FTIR. TOP-SA’s toxicity was investigated using human cells in vitro.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to simulate the dissolved solids content. In every test, the initial draw solution (DS) concentration was fixed at 4.5 M for NaCl and 2 M for MgCl<inf>2</inf>. Parameters considered in the investigation included membrane crossflow velocity (0.25 and 1.0 cm/s), flow configuration (co-current versus counter-current), direction of ultrasound waves relative to the membrane side (active layer versus support layer), and type of draw solution (NaCl versus MgCl<inf>2</inf>). A two-level factorial design was considered in the analysis of the results obtained from the experimental work. Based on the factorial design analysis, crossflow velocity and use of ultrasound have a positive effect on water flux enhancement for both draw solutions. However, the velocity effect on water flux enhancement was more pronounced than that of the use of ultrasound. The effect of flow configuration was statistically insignificant for both draw solutions. The interaction effect between crossflow velocity and ultrasound was statistically significant for both draw solutions. However, the interaction between crossflow velocity and flow configuration was only significant for the case of MgCl<inf>2</inf>. The three-way interaction was insignificant for both draw solutions. The developed factorial model equations were used to predict other flux data in ultrasound-assisted FO systems and showed adequate representation of these data at relatively similar conditions after adjustment of the model for the baseline conditions of the evaluated cases."

This is due to the continued increase of the world population and scarcity of clean water sources.

Those mechanisms can be classified as either physical, chemical, or biological. Wastewater treatment plants consist of different stages starting from the preliminary stage to the secondary stage. The physical and chemical treatments precede the secondary treatment. The focus of this chapter will be on the secondary stage of wastewater treatment, whereby different microorganisms are used in wastewater treatment. This falls under the biological treatment category. Microorganisms clean wastewater by breaking down various pollutants, more specifically, organic matter. Microbes are used to facilitate the degradation of the organic content including, but not limited to, fungi, protozoa, algae, and bacteria, which can function under aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions.

To enhance this efficiency, consideration must be given to the factors that affect dust deposition ranging from panel configuration to weather conditions. This research aims to determine which of those factors contribute significantly to dust accumulation and model this behavior. Numerical experiments were performed to study those factors based on a planned Design of Experiments (DOE). Dust particle size, dust amount, wind speed, wind direction, and the solar panel tilt angle are the five factors examined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Statistical and regression analyses were then used to determine the most significant factors and model their effect on the deposition rate. Results revealed that the dust diameter, panel tilt angle, and wind speed influence the deposition rate the most. Dust diameter is positively correlated to the dust deposition rate. Larger dust particles have a lower deposition rate as the wind velocity increases. In addition, smaller dust particles will always give the lowest dust deposition rate irrespective of the tilt angle. It was also seen that the maximum dust deposition rate occurs at a panel's tilt angle of approximately 50 deg regardless of the wind speed or the dust particle size. The developed mathematical model shows the factors contributing to soiling and panel efficiency reduction over exposure time. This model can be used further to optimize panel cleaning frequency."

    "abstract": "Water scarcity is an increasing problem on every continent, which instigated the search for novel ways to provide clean water suitable for human use; one such way is desalination. Desalination refers to the process of purifying salts and contaminants to produce water suitable for domestic and industrial applications. Due to the high costs and energy consumption associated with some desalination techniques, membrane-based technologies have emerged as a promising alternative water treatment, due to their high energy efficiency, operational simplicity, and lower cost. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge to membrane-based separation as it has detrimental effects on the membrane’s performance and integrity. Based on the type of accumulated foulants, fouling can be classified into particulate, organic, inorganic, and biofouling. Biofouling is considered the most problematic among the four fouling categories. Therefore, proper characterization and prediction of biofouling are essential for creating efficient control and mitigation strategies to minimize the damage associated with biofouling. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting membrane fouling has garnered a great deal of attention due to its adaptive capability and prediction accuracy. This paper presents an overview of the membrane biofouling mechanisms, characterization techniques, and predictive methods with a focus on AI-based techniques, and mitigation strategies."

Apart from the rising energy needs, the demand for freshwater is correspondingly increasing. A population of around 3.8 billion people will face water scarcity by 2030, as per the reports of the World Water Council. This may be due to global climate change and the deficiency in the treatment of wastewater. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies fail to completely remove several emerging contaminants, especially those containing pharmaceutical compounds. Hence, leading to an increase in the concentration of harmful chemicals in the human food chain and the proliferation of several diseases. MXenes are transition metal carbide/nitride ceramics that primarily structure the leading 2D material group. MXenes act as novel nanomaterials for wastewater treatment due to their high surface area, excellent adsorption properties, and unique physicochemical properties, such as high electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity. MXenes are highly hydrophilic and covered with active functional groups (i.e., hydroxyl, oxygen, fluorine, etc.), which makes them efficient adsorbents for a wide range of species and promising candidates for environmental remediation and water treatment. This work concludes that the scaling up process of MXene-based materials for water treatment is currently of high cost. The up-to-date applications are still limited because MXenes are currently produced mainly in the laboratory with limited yield. It is recommended to direct research efforts towards lower synthesis cost procedures coupled with the use of more environmentally friendly materials to avoid secondary contamination."

    "abstract": "The detection of leakages in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) is usually challenging and identifying their locations may take a long time. Current water leak detection methods such as model-based and measurement-based approaches face significant limitations that impact response times, resource requirements, accuracy, and location identification. This paper presents a method for determining locations in the WDNs that are vulnerable to leakage by combining six leakage-conditioning factors using logistic regression and vulnerability analysis. The proposed model considered three fixed physical factors (pipe length per junction, number of fittings per length, and pipe friction factor) and three varying operational aspects (drop in pressure, decrease in flow, and variations in chlorine levels). The model performance was validated using 13 district metered areas (DMAs) of the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA) WDN using ArcGIS. Each of the six conditioning factors was assigned a weight that reflects its contribution to leakage in the WDNs based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The highest weight was set to 0.25 for both pressure and flow, while 0.2 and 0.14 were set for the chlorine and number of fittings per length, respectively. The minimum weight was set to 0.08 for both length per junction and friction factor. When the model runs, it produces vulnerability to leakage maps, which indicate the DMAs’ vulnerability classes ranging from very high to very low. Real-world data and different scenarios were used to validate the method, and the areas vulnerable to leakage were successfully identified based on fixed physical and varying operational factors. This vulnerability map will provide a comprehensive understanding of the risks facing a system and help stakeholders develop and implement strategies to mitigate the leakage. Therefore, water utility companies can employ this method for corrective maintenance activities and daily operations. The proposed approach can offer a valuable tool for reducing water production costs and increasing the efficiency of WDN."

Unregulated leaching of micro and nanoplastics from plastic pipes of the distribution system is therefore a cause for concern, particularly with the rise in research associating these plastic particles to adverse health impacts in living organisms. Within this study, four parameters (pH, free chlorine concentration, pipe material, and time) were varied in a pipe loop network to observe their effect on microplastic (MP) and nanoplastic (NP) leaching into the simulated distribution network. Results indicated an abundance of MPs/NPs in different shapes and sizes throughout the samples. Graphical trends illustrated that basic pH values contributed to a higher number of particles. Statistical analysis via analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed this observation and further showed interaction of chlorine dose and pH concentration (p-value = 0.000), and chlorine dose and pipe material (p-value = 0.038) was also significant to leaching. Numerically, polyethylene (PE) particles were the most abundant with a total of 15194 particles, followed by 12920 polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) particles and 12317 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles. It was also noticed that the number of particles decreased with time.© 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Oysters play an essential role in the nearshore coasts where they work as an active filter. They filter nutrients, phytoplankton, sediments, heavy metals, and toxins out of the water, which improves the water quality. This is the first study that characterizes oyster bed habitats in the UAE by analyzing water quality parameters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)and heavy metals in water, sediments and oyster samples collected from five locations along the coasts of Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm al Quwain. Oyster bed areas supported a diverse assemblage of benthic life including oysters, scallops, pen shells, hard corals, and macroalgae. Mobile species in these habitats included groupers, emperors, snappers, sea snakes, among others. The phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates, and small cryptophytes. Harmful diatom Pseudonitzschia was found in all locations. No detectable concentrations of PAHs and OCPs were reported in this study, and water quality parameters were within the acceptable levels for the region. On the other hand, water quality index was reported marginal, mostly due to the presence of higher than acceptable concentrations of chromium and mercury in all sites studied. Bioconcentration factors concluded that oysters were able to bioconcentrate metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and zinc, when compared to water. No detectable concentrations of lead and mercury were reported in oysters, suggesting higher depuration rates for those metals."

Membrane-based water treatment technologies are among the most preferred options due to their commercial success, simple operation, low energy and space requirements, and high separation efficiency. Despite the advances made in membrane-based technologies, fouling remains a critical challenge. Fouling occurs upon the accumulation of unwanted impurities on the membrane surface and within the membrane pores which results in a significant decline in the membrane permeate flux. To alleviate the operational challenges from fouling, surface modification to develop antifouling membranes appears to be an effective technique. A comprehensive review of the surface modification techniques for the development of antifouling membranes is provided in this paper. Chemical surface modification techniques (grafting and plasma treatment), physical modification techniques (blending, coating, adsorption, and thermal treatment), and combined physical and chemical modification techniques have been discussed. Moreover, the challenges related to surface modification and the future research directions are addressed.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

Recently, researchers have been focusing on developing an innovative and susceptible solution using composite beads that effectively combat this issue. In this paper, beads were synthesized using a sodium alginate (SA) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) through a simple dipping process. Several characterization tests were performed including XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA, and SEM-EDX. The SEM images confirmed that SA effectively coated the cubical structure of the ZIF-8, ensuring optimal performance. The efficiency of the resulting SA@ZIF-8 composite beads was tested on both synthetic malachite green dye and real industrial wastewater samples using batch and fixed bed column reactors. The findings revealed that maximum adsorption of 95.5% was achieved at pH 6 in 120 min of reaction time. FTIR and SEM analysis also confirmed the adsorption of MG dye onto the beads. The Freundlich isotherm model (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.99) has a better fit than the Langmuir (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.96) for describing the adsorption process. The PSO model predicted the kinetics of the system, whereas the intraparticle diffusion study supported the system's mechanistic analysis. Furthermore, the study also investigated the efficacy of the beads in treating real wastewater effluent samples collected from the dye industry. Overall, using sodium alginate-coated ZIF-8 beads was found to have many advantages over powdered ZIF-8, including higher selectivity, stability, reusability, and practicality, making them a promising alternative for adsorption applications. Therefore, these composite beads have the potential for the removal of the dye from wastewater, which could be widely applied in various industries."

This paper presents a dimensionless mathematical model that relates pressure drop to leakage in a water distribution system. The relationship was achieved through an experimental setup at the American University of Sharjah. The dimensionless relationship between pressure drops percentile and the flow ratio were obtained exponentially. The proposed dimensionless model correlated well with all experimental data and calculated the pressure drop with the amount of leakage within 10% accuracy in all pipe diameters. This model provides a basis for an easy and efficient method to detect leakage in pipe systems without the need for expensive equipment."

Timely leak detection and location identification have been challenges. In this paper, an integrated approach to geospatial and infrared image processing was used for robust leak detection. The method combines drops in flow, pressure, and chlorine residuals to determine potential water leakage locations in the WDN using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. GIS layers were created from the hourly values of these three parameters for the city of Sharjah provided by the Sharjah Electricity, Water, and Gas Authority (SEWA). These layers are then analyzed for locations with dropped values of each of the parameters and are overlaid with each other. In the case where there were no overlaying locations between flow and pressure, further water quality analysis was avoided, assuming no potential leak. In the case where there are locations with drops in flow and pressure layers, these overlaying locations are then examined for drops in chlorine values. If overlaying locations are found, then these regions are considered potential leak locations. Once potential leak locations are identified, a specialized remote sensing technique can be used to pinpoint the leak location. This study also demonstrated the suitability of using an infrared camera for leak detection in a laboratory-based setup. This paper concludes that the following methodology can help water utility companies in the timely detection of leaks, saving money, time, and effort."

A flood frequency analysis has been traditionally performed under stationarity assumption indicating that the statistical properties of historical flooding will not change over time. Climate change and variability challenges the stationarity assumption, and a flood frequency analysis without consideration of non-stationarity can result in under- or overestimation of the design floods. In this study, non-stationarity of annual maximum floods (AMFs) was investigated through a methodology consisting of trend and change point tests, and non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NSGEV) models, and the methodology was applied to Campaspe River Basin as a case study. Statistically significant decreasing trends in AMFs were detected for almost all stations at the 0.01 significance level in Campaspe River Basin. NSGEV models outperformed the stationary counterparts (SGEV) for some stations based on statistical methods (i.e., Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)) and graphical approaches (i.e., probability and quantile plots). For example, at Station 406235, AIC and BIC values were found to be 334 and 339, respectively, for the SGEV model, whereas AIC and BIC values were calculated as 330 and 334, respectively, for the NSGEV 15 model with time-varying location and scale parameters.

This review aims to critically examine recent advancements in developing MOFs-based adsorbents and photocatalysts for eliminating water pollutants.

    "abstract": "Managing municipal waste is a critical issue in the modern world. The accumulation of waste and improper management has led to serious health and environmental problems. Traditionally, trashcans are distributed among different areas for waste collection. Unfortunately, this gives rise to serious problems including overflow of bins, which can cause spreading in surrounding areas, pollution and causing hazardous inconvenience to the public. Therefore, there is a need for smart and efficient monitoring systems that can predict and then prevent such incidents by notifying the municipality when collection is needed. This can be done using a model that is capable of forecasting short-term waste generation at the bin level to help in optimizing waste collection, where only bins that are expected to reach a certain level of fullness during the next shift will be collected. Such a system can reduce the operation cost while minimizing traveled distances, and eventually reduce emissions caused by collecting trucks. Consequently, we propose an IoT-based monitoring system for effective management of waste. The proposed system is equipped with a predictive module that uses historical waste collection data gathered by implanted sensors to forecast the daily waste generation and accordingly suggests a smart collection schedule.

These systems utilize resonant inductive power transfer (RIPT) to charge EVs on-the-move, i.e. by powering the EVs wirelessly from the roadway rather than from a stationary charging pad. Nonetheless, the inherent misalignments during the vehicle's motion significantly reduce the power transfer efficiency, and hence the power received by the EV from the DWC lane. Hence, accurate misalignment detection and correction techniques are required to maximize the power transferred in DWC systems. This work proposes a low complexity, discrete misalignment detection system using an array of auxiliary sensor coils. The size and positioning of the array ensures minimal interruption to the main power flow from the transmitter charging pad to the EV receiver. The proposed system detects the misalignment of EVs in discrete steps using the rectified induced voltage on the sensor coil array. Finite element method (FEM) simulations verify the operation of the proposed system and accurate misalignment positioning is confirmed by circuit simulations. Further optimization is required to minimize the coupling losses due to cross coupling between the adjacent auxiliary coils."

    "abstract": "Pipe leakage in water distribution networks (WDNs) has been an emerging concern for water utilities worldwide due to its public health and economic significance. Not only does it cause significant water losses, but it also deteriorates the quality of the treated water in WDNs. Hence, a prompt response is required to avoid or minimize the eventual consequences. This raises the necessity of exploring the possible approaches for detecting and locating leaks in WDNs promptly. Currently, various leak detection methods exist, but they are not accurate and reliable in detecting leaks. This paper presents a novel GIS-based spatial machine learning technique that utilizes currently installed pressure, flow, and water quality monitoring sensors in WDNs, specifically employing the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) models, based on a WDN dataset provided by our partner utility authority. In addition to its ability as a regression model for predicting a dependent variable based on input variables, GWR was selected to help identify locations on the WDN where coefficients deviate the most from the overall coefficients. To corroborate the GWR results, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is used as an unsupervised machine learning model to predict leak locations based on spatial local density, where locality is given by k-nearest neighbours. The sample WDN dataset provided by our utility partner was split into 70:30 for training and testing of the GWR model. The GWR model was able to predict leaks (detection and location) with a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.909. The LOF model was able to predict the leaks with a matching of 80% with the GWR results. Then, a customized GIS interface was developed to automate the detection process in real-time as the sensor’s readings were recorded and spatial machine learning was used to process the readings. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to robustly detect and locate leaks in WDNs."

However, timely leak detection and location identification has been a challenge. In this paper, a new method for robust leak detection is presented. Normally, water leakage causes drops in flow, pressure, and/or chlorine around leak locations. Our method uses simultaneous drops in these parameters to determine potential water leakage locations in the WDN using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The method starts by creating GIS layers from the hourly values of these three parameters using a test database provided by Sharjah Electricity, Water and Gas Authority (SEWA). These layers are then analyzed where groups of locations with dropped values of each of the parameters are identified and overlaid with each other, which may result with one or more locations or with no locations at all. In the case where there are no overlaying locations between these two parameters the conclusion would be there are no leaks in the WDN. Our tool then examines if the locations with drops in flow and pressure also encountered drops in chlorine. This may also result with one or more locations or no overlaying locations at all. If there are no overlaying locations at this stage of the analysis that means no leaks. However, if overlaid locations are identified, then these are considered potential leak locations. This method as demonstrated on the WDN of SEWA can help water utility companies in the timely detection of leaks saving money, time, and effort."

    "abstract": "Many countries have reached a point where the availability of clean water resources is limiting their economic progress. This problem is especially relevant in countries with limited water or water treatment, such as the Middle East. Solar desalination is a treatment process that can be used globally to produce freshwater. This project developed a pilot-scale, hybrid portable solar desalination system to treat saline water as well as produce freshwater from humid air. The saline water was collected from the local beach and used in the desalination unit, while an electrically powered humidifier was utilized to produce potable water from the humid air. The study investigated the water productivity and efficiency of the system. Using sensors, the times during the day when humidity and temperature peaked were monitored to determine the relationship between water production and climatic conditions. The water samples produced were tested for turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, and pH. The system achieved 88.6% removal of TDS and a produced water turbidity of < 1.0 NTU. Both the desalinated water and the dehumidified water were within the general guidelines for potable water. The unit produced around 32 L/day of water with a cost of around $0.034/L of water. The developed desalination unit can produce potable water using renewable energy at low costs, therefore improving access to freshwater for communities with restricted access to freshwater."

    "title": "Improving Resilience in Water Distribution System — Serter Atabay, Maruf Mortula",
    "abstract": "There has been an emerging realization that resilient water infrastructure is critical to ensuring sustainable urban water management. A water distribution system (WDS) including the pipe network is one of the critical components of the water supply system that ensures delivering adequate safe water to the end-users. Natural events such as earthquakes and climate change may result in preventing the WDS from continuing its critical services. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the system's resilience against disaster. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the resilience of the system that is subjected to exceptional failure conditions. The global resilience analysis (GRA) approach is utilized to measure the resilience of the WDS. Hypothetical simulations of failure scenarios are tested to evaluate the resiliency of WDS by using (Water CAD). The model of WDS in the University City, Sharjah, is utilized to apply the proposed approach. For each failure scenario, the corresponding failure impacts such as supply shortage and contaminated pipes are identified. The results revealed that the failure scenario with the highest supply shortage percentage was 98.95% and the corresponding ratio of the contaminated pipe was 0.57. Additionally, it revealed that the supply shortage depends on the criticality of the pipe in the WDS. (e.g., almost full supply shortage with only 1% pipe failure). It indicates that a small number of critical components can almost prevent the entire system from supplying the water to the end-users, while a large number of failed components in other scenarios can still supply 55–90% of the demand to the end-users. The study concludes that GRA provides an overview of the resilience of WDS to extreme failure scenarios and quantifies the resilience of the system."

Membrane technologies, such as microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and reverse osmosis, have proven to be efficient and economical methods for wastewater treatment. The presence of microbes in wastewater can have a negative impact on the overall performance of these technologies, mainly through microbial fouling. Microbes facilitate the growth of a thick biofilm layer on the membrane's surface, resulting in a drop in process efficiency. On the other hand, microbes can be effectively integrated with membrane technologies to create sustainable and reliable water treatment processes. A membrane bioreactor is an example of the successful integration of microbes in membrane technologies to produce high-quality effluents. Another example is microbial fuel cells, where microbes break down organic matter to generate electricity using a proton exchange membrane. Therefore, this chapter investigates the role that microbes play in membrane technologies for wastewater treatment. The discussion begins with a summary of the various types of membrane processes utilized in treating wastewater.

Besides this, the decontamination of industrial wastewater could be achieved via the implementation of carbon nanomaterial modified TiO2 as photocatalysts that can effectively adsorb and degrade the pollutant. Furthermore, the removal of contaminants of emerging concern, such as antibiotics, via the utilization of nanophotocatalysts has demonstrated great potential with high removal efficiencies. Additionally, novel photochemical enzyme systems have also exhibited promising removal activities in industrial wastewater treatment.

The first system, PV-FW, uses a transparent water channel in front of the panel to cool it, while the second system, PV-BW, cools the panel by circulating water through a cooling plate attached to its back. Compared to a standalone PV panel, the PV-FW system reduced surface temperatures by 22.4°C, and the PV-BW system achieved a reduction of 17.8°C. However, the electrical efficiency results differed significantly. The PV-BW system improved electrical efficiency by 6.86%, whereas the PV-FW system decreased efficiency by 69.21 %, primarily due to the acrylic and water layer reducing the transmission of ultraviolet and visible light, as confirmed by spectrometer measurements. Despite its lower electrical performance, the PV-FW system excelled in generating water with higher thermal energy content, making it better suited for applications prioritizing thermal energy collection. On the other hand, the PV-BW system proved more effective for maximizing electrical power output, offering a balanced approach to temperature control and energy production.

To address the freshwater crisis, desalination methods like reverse osmosis are widely adopted. Simultaneously, the push for carbon neutrality has boosted interest in clean energy alternatives, such as electric vehicles and hydrogen, to decarbonize energy systems. In this regard, this study proposes a day-ahead optimization model aimed at reducing operational and environmental costs while meeting the demands for pure water and hydrogen. The proposed model is comprehensive, incorporating key energy hub (EH) components, specifically wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, and combined cooling, heating, and power systems.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen-based generation and storage technologies have been increasingly emerging as an appealing candidate for decarbonizing different sectors, including microgrids and transportation. Practically, energy hubs (EH) and Hydrogen refueling stations (HRS) could provide an ideal environment for integrating such technologies. However, the management process involves several conflicting objectives that must be met to a satisfactory extent. In this regard, this paper proposes a stochastic bi-level tri-objective optimization framework for the planning and operation of EHs and on-site green/blue HRSs. The multiple objectives involve total cost (i.e., capital, operation and maintenance, Hydrogen, and emissions), load profile deviation resulting from engaging the demand response program (DRP), and the dissatisfaction of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCVs) owners. The proposed model forms a bi-level optimization strategy. The upper-level optimization (i.e., planning level) optimizes the sizes and locations of renewable energy sources (RESs) along with the capacities, rates, and locations of the other resources (i.e., photovoltaic, wind turbine, Hydrogen storage system, thermal storage system) integrated into both EHs and HRSs incorporated into the IEEE-69 system. On the other hand, the lower level (i.e., operation level) precisely optimizes the charging and discharging profiles of the different resources incorporated in EHs and HRSs along with FCVs. The Pareto optimal solution is employed to find the best-compromised solution among the conflicting tri-objective solutions. The simulation results demonstrate that the green-controlled approach has validated its superiority for net-zero emissions transition with a 10.74 % reduction in emissions costs at almost the same total cost compared to the other approaches (i.e., blue-uncontrolled, blue-controlled, green-uncontrolled)."

Hence, in this study, lignin and nanocellulose were investigated for the first time for high-temperature fuel cell applications. They were synthesized using the gel casting technique, with Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) serving as a supporting matrix for enhancing the mechanical strength and durability of membranes. The Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the incorporation of nanocellulose within the lignin fibers, while the X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the amorphous structure of the membrane surface upon the addition of nanocellulose into lignin. The intrinsic lignin membranes demonstrated a promising proton conductivity of 6.08 × 10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm at room temperature. The introduction of 22 wt % of nanocellulose led to a tenfold increase in proton conductivity (1.2 × 10<sup>−2</sup> S/cm), which could be attributed to enhanced proton conduction paths. The membranes' conductivity remained within the10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm range at 150 °C, indicating notable thermal stability and improved water retention. Moreover, the addition of nanocellulose increased the membrane's water intake capacity by more than three times, rising from 5 % in the lignin/PVDF membrane to 17 % upon the inclusion of nanocellulose. In addition, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data showed that the membranes have a high thermal stability by maintaining ∼ 90 % of their weight at temperatures higher than 300<sup>o</sup>C.

While functional, supercapacitors are often fabricated from high-cost materials. This work aims at synthesizing a lower cost, supercapacitor based on ultrathin zinc-cobalt (ZC) oxide nanowalls supported on a copper tape (Cu) via a hydrothermal method. The structural and electrochemical characteristics were evaluated for energy storage applications. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) confirmed the formation of ultrathin ZC/Cu nanowalls with a surface roughness of 233 nm, while elemental analysis (XRF) revealed the presence of 32.3 % zinc and 67.7 % cobalt. The crystallinity degree of the prepared samples was examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and showed enhanced properties. The electrochemical analysis demonstrated an optimum specific capacitance of 205 F/g at a scanning rate of 10 mV/s within a potential window ranging from 0.0 (V) to 0.7 (V). The galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves exhibited an asymmetric triangular-like shape. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data showed a low transfer resistance of 13Ω, demonstrating efficient transport of ions at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The results reported in this work suggest that the prepared ZC/Cu materials are promising for supercapacitive energy storage applications."

To overcome the limitations of low airflow rates in conventional designs, tangential partition walls (TPWs) are introduced in the collector section to induce a swirling motion, thereby enhancing airflow and thermal performance. A three-dimensional computational model was developed using ANSYS FLUENT and validated against experimental data from a solar chimney located in Al Ain, UAE. The model was used to analyze flow behavior and assess the average velocity and temperature at the chimney inlet. Results show that TPWs significantly impact SC performance. A configuration with 3 TPWs demonstrated marked improvements in flow velocity and temperature uniformity compared to the baseline design without TPWs. Further enhancement was observed with additional TPWs: a system with 8 TPWs, a 100 m² collector area, and a 0.24 m chimney entrance diameter yielded a 350 % increase in kinetic energy. These improvements are attributed to the swirling flow generated near the chimney entrance, which promotes a coherent updraft and reduces recirculation zones. The findings confirm that TPWs offer a promising strategy to boost SC efficiency and support scalable clean energy solutions."

Accurate estimation of their remaining useful life (RUL) is essential for enhancing system reliability, optimizing maintenance strategies, and minimizing costs. In this work, battery degradation is inferred from voltage signal behavior, which serves as a reliable non-invasive indicator of aging. We propose a novel model called Weibull Distribution-Informed Neural Network (WDINN), which integrates the probabilistic characteristics of the Weibull distribution into a physics-informed deep learning framework. This approach addresses both the non-linear and stochastic nature of battery degradation. To train and validate the model, degradation profiles were extracted from aging datasets and reference performance testing (RPT) data. The WDINN model demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art models, including Bi-LSTM, GRU, and ANN. It achieved an RMSE of 0.00027 ± 0.00003 on the aging dataset. Cluster-based evaluation further revealed that WDINN performs particularly well in scenarios of slow, long-term degradation (e.g., Cluster 0), achieving a test loss of 0.00018 ± 0.00001, while maintaining robustness across more variable short-term degradation patterns in the RPT data.

This study compares different operational scenarios of Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and renewable energy sources (RESs) integration in coupled power and gas networks using an optimal day-ahead operation approach. The proposed models minimize total operational costs by optimizing the interaction between power and gas networks, reducing curtailed RESs power through hydrogen conversion, and addressing seasonal energy demands, filling a gap in existing research that mainly focuses on hydrogen integration within the electrical system alone. What is the implication of the main finding? The findings highlight that co-optimizing gas and power systems through Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) integration can significantly enhance energy efficiency, reducing total operational costs by up to 20% and curtailing renewable energy wastage by over 50%, thereby improving overall system reliability and resilience. By mitigating cascading outage risks and strengthening energy security, the proposed approach supports the transition to clean and sustainable energy systems, aligning with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), resilient infrastructure (SDG 9), and climate action (SDG 13). The rapid growth in natural gas consumption by gas-fired generators and the emergence of power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology have increased the interdependency of natural gas and power systems, presenting new challenges to energy system operators due to the heterogeneous uncertainties associated with power loads, renewable energy sources (RESs), and gas loads. These uncertainties can easily spread from one infrastructure to another, increasing the risk of cascading outages. Given the erratic nature of RESs, P2H technology provides a valuable solution for large-scale energy storage systems, crucial for the transition to economic, clean, and secure energy systems. This paper proposes a new approach for the co-optimized operation of gas and electric power systems, aiming to reduce combined operating costs by 10–15% without jeopardizing gas and energy supplies to customers. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed for the optimal day-ahead operation of these integrated systems, with a case study involving the IEEE 24-bus power system and a 20-node natural gas system. Simulation results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in minimizing total costs by up to 20% and significantly reducing renewable energy curtailment by over 50%.

This facile and scalable method enables the simultaneous synthesis and deposition of few-layer graphene onto porous metallic substrates without the need for high-temperature processing or hazardous chemicals. The resulting electrodes are thoroughly characterized in terms of their structural, electrochemical, and optical properties to confirm successful graphene integration. Surface characterization through Raman confirms the successful deposition of a few layers of graphene on the metallic foams. The graphene flakes appear to be well adhered to the surface of foam due to high-energy mechanical collisions in the ball milling, resulting in improved surface roughness, flake embedding, and interfacial contact. Electrochemical testing for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) revealed notable improvements in catalytic performance. Enhancements were observed with graphene deposition, where Tafel slope for graphene deposit foams decreased by 2.4 %, and 5 %, for Cu foam and Ni foam, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the increased surface area, enhanced conductivity, and higher density of active sites provided by the graphene coating. The results highlight the potential of combining porous metal foams with graphene nanostructures to create cost-effective and high-performance electrodes for PV-electrolysis systems.

This paper proposes a two-stage framework based on the deployment of mobile energy storage (MES) to enhance the resilience of IDIMGs. In the first stage, the network configuration and deployment of MES are optimized to maximize the system loadability. The proposed formulation for this stage is a stochastic multi-period mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that maximizes a weighted sum of minimax loadabilities. In the second stage, transitional locations of MES, line-exchange execution sequence, and droop control of dispatchable sources are jointly optimized to mitigate line-switching disturbances that occur when transitioning to the new network configuration obtained in the first stage. The second stage model is a multi-objective MINLP. The proposed models are solved within the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS), utilizing a modified IEEE 33-bus system.

The BSS has several swapping bays such that each can accommodate an EV for swapping single or multiple battery units. The proposed BSS model considers serving different types of EVs using a heterogeneous battery stock. The charging of the depleted batteries (DBs) is performed using continuously controlled variable chargers which makes it more flexible for providing grid services. While previous studies focused on day-ahead modeling of BSSs, our study considers BSS dynamic scheduling. The goal is to maximize the daily profit using an RHO mechanism to provide optimal swapping and charging/discharging processes. The problem is defined as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), then it's linearized into a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) to reduce the computational complexity. To predict the EV's swapping demand, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is utilized as a time series forecasting engine. The proposed model is validated through a set of case studies comparing the LSTM-based RHO mechanism versus unscheduled operation and day-ahead scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic scheduling mechanism increases the profit between 10% and 25.7% compared to the day-ahead scheduling. Furthermore, the number of EVs served using the proposed approach increases between 11% and 14% compared to the day-ahead model."

    "abstract": "This work provides a comprehensive review on the incorporation of ionic liquid (ILs) into polymer blends and their utilization as proton exchanges membranes (PEM). Various conventional polymers that incorporate ILs are discussed, such as Nafion, poly (vinylidene fluoride), polybenzimidazole, sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone), and sulfonated polyimide. The methods of synthesis of IL/polymer composite membranes are summarized and the role of ionic liquids as electrolytes and structure directing agents in PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs) is presented. In addition, the obstacles that are reported to impede the development of commercial polymerized IL membranes are highlighted in this work. The paper concludes that the presence of certain ILs can increase the conductivity of the PEM, and consequently, enhance the performance of PEMFCs. Nevertheless, the leakage of ILs from composite membranes as well as the limited long-term thermal and mechanical stability are considered as the main challenges that limit the employment of IL/polymer composite membranes in PEMFCs, especially for high-temperature applications."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy storage systems (ESSs) alongside the continuous enhancements to storage technology have been of great positive impact on the electric grid. Their unceasing development has been driven by the need to accommodate increased penetration of renewable energy resources and defer capital investments, among other benefits. Moreover, ESSs have played a key role in the grid’s ability to cope with its ever-shifting load profiles, resulting in large economic gain for ESS owners. For this reason, this prospective study was designed to investigate privately-owned energy storage hubs (ESHs) and their interactions with potential customers as well as with the electric grid. This research examined two contrasting interaction approaches for customer-owned stationary energy storage hubs: a cooperative and a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach. The goal of the cooperative technique is to conduce to a correlated equilibrium increasing the social welfare of all players involved using a regret matching algorithm. On the other hand, in the non-cooperative approach, modeled as an ascending price-clinching auction, each player acts greedily, maximizing only their individual welfare. Implementing both case studies resulted in important insights into ESH players’ interactions and provided contrasting methods of modeling their behaviors. Finally, depending on the application at hand, the choice of one approach may be more realistic than the other."

    "abstract": "The fluctuated output power of the large-scale wind farms (WF) and their fault transient characteristics have an adverse effect on the current differential protection systems of the transmission lines. With increased transmission line length and in the case of weak output power from the WF, the differential current between both line ends increases in normal conditions since the capacitive current is comparable to the load current. This paper proposes a new differential protection algorithm for transmission lines connected to large-scale wind farms. The proposed current differential protection algorithm is developed based on the signs of the phase current samples at both line ends, instead of utilizing directly the current magnitudes. The similarity between the signs of the phase current samples at both line ends is evaluated utilizing the signed correlation criterion, and the fault detection index is calculated to discriminate the internal faults from other events. In addition, a new online technique is introduced to adjust the protection settings considering the different output power levels of the WF. The conducted PSCAD/EMTDC simulation studies confirm the acceptable performance of the proposed protection algorithm for numerous normal and fault scenarios, including different fault resistances and inception angles as well as all fault types. The effect of line length, type of wind turbine generator, and different values of WF output power are also considered."

    "abstract": "Due to their efficient and cleaner operation nature, proton exchange membrane fuel cells are considered energy conversion devices for various applications including transportation. However, the high manufacturing cost of the fuel cell system components remains the main barrier to their general acceptance and commercialization. The main strategy for lowering the cost of fuel cells which is critical for their general acceptance as alternative energy sources in a variety of applications is to lower the cost of the electrolyte and catalyst. An electrolyte is one of the most important components in the fuel cell and a major contributor to the cost (>$500/m<sup>2</sup> for commercial Nafion® series). Nafion is widely used as an electrolyte in PEMs, but it has some limitations in addition to high costs such as low proton conductivity, high-temperature performance degradation, and high fuel crossover. Therefore, the development and manufacturing of low-cost and high-performance electrolyte membranes with higher conductivity (∼0.1 S·cm <sup>−1</sup>) at a wider temperature range is a top priority in the scientific community. Recent years have seen extensive research on the preparation, modification, and properties of PEMs such as non-Nafion membranes (SPI, PBI, polystyrene, polyphosphazene, SPAEK, SPEEK, SPAS, SPEN), and their composites by incorporating functionalized CNTs, GO as fillers to overcome their drawbacks.

Standardized electric vehicle tests are conducted and used to validate the proposed technique, such as dynamic stress test, urban dynamometer driving schedule, and constant-current discharge tests at different temperatures.

Several mass ratios of ZrSi/ILs were investigated. 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide [HMIM][TCM] and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate [BMIM][SCN] ILs were used in this study. The membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesized composite membranes demonstrated high proton conductivity in the range of 0.1–0.2 S/cm at 25 °C, exceeding that of Nafion (0.01 S/cm). Furthermore, the synthesized composite membranes were processed at a high temperature (200 °C), and exhibited a high proton conductivity of 0.001 S/cm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated a slight weight loss of around 200 °C and an approximately 18% weight loss at around 500 °C for the synthesized membrane. SEM illustrated the formation of very small crystalline particles within the confined pores of PTFE, upon the addition of ILs. Water uptake analysis revealed that the composite membranes in this study could hold water by more than 50% by weight. The results showed enhanced proton conductivities that can be attributed to the enhanced water uptake and the presence of multiple proton-conducting paths within the membrane matrix."

This paper focuses on reducing the maintenance costs by initiating cleaning actions when the dust level exceeds a threshold value. The amount of dust accumulated on the PV panels is estimated using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Experiments are conducted to collect the required data which are used in training the ANN model. Then, this ANN model will be fed by the output power from solar panels, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance and thus, it will be able to estimate the amount of dust accumulated on solar panels at these conditions.

Simulations reveal an improvement in the misalignment tolerance range when the quadrature coil is utilized, as long as the current flow direction is matched between the secondary Q coil and the coupled rectangular portion of the primary DD coil.

These models are used to accurately capture the electrical characteristics and runtime performance. This work proposes a well-known equivalent circuit model of a battery, to be modified and used as a model for a PEMFC stacks voltage-current characteristics. This model is modified by finding suitable functions to model the open circuit voltage and the series resistance, required to model the electrical performance of a 200-W PEMFC stack. The paper also shows that the existing adaptive parameters estimation (APE) technique for Li-ion battery parameters estimation is also able to estimate parameters of the PEMFC stack's model. The model parameters are estimated using the APE technique that requires only five experiments. The model is validated experimentally under different load conditions for a 200-W PEMFC stack supplied from a hydrogen cylinder (voltage error −0.2 V to 0.5 V), and a 30-W PEMFC stack supplied from a fuel stick (voltage error −0.2 V–0.4 V). The results show that the parameters estimation methodology works well across PEMFC stacks of different sizes with different input fuel intake configurations, with a minimal terminal voltage estimation error in the order of millivolts. Open circuit voltage measurements (OCV) show that the OCV curve starts at a little lower than 31 V, declines slowly to around 30 V for a normalized hydrogen flow rate of 0.6, after which there is a sudden linear decline in OCV was observed. Most of the data has absolute estimation error less than 0.1 V. In fact, the terminal voltage estimation error across all tests, with different current discharge profiles, lies between −0.2 and 0.2 V only. Also, 95.84% of the error samples lie between ±0.1% error."

However, the main limitation that is slowing down the adoption of electric vehicles is range anxiety, where users are discouraged to drive an electric vehicle (EV) due to fear of running out of charge mid-trip. This revealed the need for implementing better EV charging solutions including dynamic wireless charging systems. Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) exploits wireless power transfer (WPT) to deliver electrical energy from the grid to the EV while in motion, via wireless charging lanes (WCL) placed on the roads. In addition to reducing range anxiety, DWC also eliminates the need for charging downtime. However, expensive infrastructure is needed to deploy the necessary hardware needed for DWC, which explains the need for optimizing the deployment locations of the charging lanes along with the corresponding lane lengths and charging power levels. In this work, the objective of the deployment optimization framework is to minimize the total system costs. The optimization framework is formulated based on traffic simulation data for the city of Sharjah. The problem is then solved using the metaheuristic genetic algorithm to provide recommendations on the most suitable locations to deploy the charging lanes within the traffic map under consideration."

We consider prescribed combination of plunging and pitching motions imposed to a NACA-0012 airfoil. We conduct a parametric study by varying the Strouhal number and the amplitude of the pitching angle to identify two operational flow regimes: power generation and thrust-producing propulsion using the feathering criterion. In the latter regime, the foil performs positive work on the surrounding fluid and therefore, the positive propulsive efficiency can be attained as long as the horizontal hydrodynamic force remains negative. For the power generation regime, the product of the lift force and plunging velocity is found mostly positive over the oscillating cycle, which indicates that the flowing fluid carries out work on the foil. The parametric study reveals that the foil can reach up to 42% power generation efficiency when setting the pitching amplitude in the range of 60° to 70°. For foils operating in the power generation regime, we present a piezoelectric energy harvester that can efficiently harness usable electric power from high fluid pressure regions. We identify two core locations based on the pressure field at which the attachment of piezoelectric patches can lead to significant energy harvesting. As such, the present study provides guidance for the design enhancement of micro-power generators relying on the interactions of flapping foils with the surrounding fluid."

The results are experimentally verified using a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell with an active surface area of 100 centimeters square. The membrane electrode assembly consists of Nafion® HP membrane. Also, AvCarb EP40 gas diffusion layers with 200 μm thicknesses are used. Results confirm that the overall stack efficiency can increase remarkably with the optimization of its operating parameters. The highest efficiencies are achieved around 100% humidity ratio of reactants at both cathode and anode. While high operating pressures improves individual cell efficiency, there are contradictory concerns at the stack level such as parasitic loads, losses, leakages and manufacturing costs."

    "abstract": "Energy hubs (EHs) are progressively being implemented in microgrids for local generation, transfer, and storage of various forms of energy. However, issues have emerged around developing an operating schedule for the different energy resources incorporated in the EHs to ensure the operation at minimum possible costs and emissions. This paper proposes a stochastic-based multi-objectives optimization model for optimal day-ahead scheduling of microgrids based on EHs. The proposed model simultaneously manages the non-dispatchable distributed generator units, such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, and energy storage systems, such as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and battery energy storage systems. Moreover, the thermal network is also established by introducing solar heat collectors, heat generated during the discharge of CAES, and thermal energy storage. Furthermore, the proposed model also considers the uncertainties of wind speed, solar radiation, and residential loads. A demand response program (DRP) is also employed to the residential and plug-in electric vehicles load to flatten the load curve and to perform more cost-effectively. A total reduction of 9.87 % and 21.41 % is achieved in the cost and emission amount, respectively, after applying the DRP. Furthermore, a decrease of 13.41 % and 45.04 % is also achieved for the costs of imported power and operation of the CAES, respectively. Different case studies are performed, and a comparative study with other existing research is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed stochastic approach for optimal day-ahead scheduling."

    "abstract": "With countries moving toward renewable energy sources (RES), the need for dispatchability and storage solutions has become more prevalent. The uncertainty associated with wind turbine (WT) units and photovoltaic (PV) systems further complex a system with a high level of intermittency. This work addresses this problem by proposing an operational planning approach to determine the optimal allocation of WT units, PV systems, and hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) in smart grids. The proposed approach considers the uncertainties of the RES and load demand, price-based demand response, and distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) functionality of the RES interfacing inverters. The operational planning problem is divided into two subcategories: (1) optimal long-term planning and (2) optimal operation. In the first problem, probabilistic models of RES and load reflect on the sizes and locations of the used RES and storage technologies. This allocation is further optimized via the optimal operation of the smart grid. The proposed operational planning approach is formulated as a nested optimization problem that guarantees the optimal planning and operation of the RES and HESS simultaneously. This approach is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system and solved using meta-heuristic and mathematical algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a set of case studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach optimally allocates the RES and HESS with a 30.4% cost reduction and 19% voltage profile improvement."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy sources (RESs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) have been extensively incorporated into distribution systems. Due to the stochastic nature of RES generation and electric vehicles (EVs), risky operational challenges might impact the grid. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework to optimally allocate EVCSs in conjunction with RESs. Specifically, the proposed RESs and EVCSs planning framework considers three sub-objectives to be minimized, i.e., voltage deviations, energy losses, and EVs owners'dissatisfaction. Further, active power curtailment of RESs is precluded while considering the diverse operational constraints of the grid, RESs, and EVCSs. To provide further benefits, advanced control schemes of the interconnecting RES inverters, grid-To-vehicle (G2V), and vehicle-To-grid (V2G) schemes are considered in the proposed framework. A two-level approach is developed to solve this holistic framework with competing sub-functions to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions. The outer optimization level precisely optimizes the RES locations and sizes, along with the optimal places of the EVCS. On the other hand, the inner level determines the optimal EVCS charging considering stochastic EV power, RES inverter reactive power, and the time-of-use energy tariff. The proposed framework has been tested on the 69-bus distribution system. The simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed RES and EVCS planning framework. The total voltage deviation and energy losses achieved by the proposed framework are reduced by 96% and 74%, respectively, with respect to the uncontrolled charging of EVs, while the owners' satisfactions are met."

In contrast to classic method like the EKF and more contemporary ones like the square root variant of the Cubature Kalman Filter (SCKF), the IEKF can successfully mimic the nonlinear dynamics and mitigate measurement noise stochasticity. Moreover, even if the measurement model fails to fully capture the cell's dynamics, the IEKF will still sustain a reasonable performance. Hence, IEKF outperforms the conventional EKF, and even the SCKF, which can diverge if a mismatch between the SOC measurement model and the true SOC measurement occurs.

    "title": "Machine Learning-Based Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction Using Origin-Destination Data: A UAE Case Study — Mohamed S. Hassan, Ahmed Osman",
    "abstract": "Optimal prediction and coordination of the energy demand of electric vehicles (EVs) is essential to address the energy availability and range anxiety concerns of current and potential EV users. As a result, different EV demand predictors are developed in the literature based on traffic simulators and/or locally-generated EV charging datasets, to provide the required inputs for EV demand management programs. These predictors, however, may not reliably scale to model the EV energy requirements in different regions, particularly with the scarcity of real-world data on EV driving patterns. This work proposes a data-driven, machine learning (ML)-based EV demand predictor based on vehicular traffic flow data between different origin-destination (OD) pairs. The proposed model incorporates the driving patterns in the regions under consideration to determine the corresponding EV energy consumption and hence, the minimum EV energy requirements per trip. The data used in this work is obtained from TomTom Move O/D Analysis portal for the cities of Dubai and Sharjah, UAE. Different ML models are trained on the dataset to develop the EV demand predictor, namely random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and linear regression models. Results reveal that the MLP offers a superior performance to all other models, with an R2 > 0.8 and a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of ≈ 20% on both the training and testing data subsets, and a significantly lower training time compared to RF and XGBoost. This makes it suitable for EV demand predictions to incorporate regular updates in vehicular traffic flow data for further model tuning."

    "abstract": "Overheating is a major problem encountered by photovoltaic (PV) cells that significantly deteriorates their performance and shortens their lifetime. For the first time, this study numerically investigated employing a nano-encapsulated phase-change material (nano-ePCM) dispersion in a double-pass photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar collector, where the multi-functional nano-ePCM dispersion simultaneously operates as an optical filter, heat carrier, and storage medium. The water-dispersed nano-ePCM particles were made of silica shells and paraffin-based cores. The proposed system was optically, thermally, and electrically modeled and evaluated after rigorous validation against published results. The performance of the PV/T system was analyzed upon varying the PCM core material, flowrate, solar intensity, particle size and loading, and channel depth and length. In addition, the proposed system (SYS-1) was compared to two alternative configurations, where one was based on a cooling channel below the PV cells without an optical filtration channel (SYS-2), and the other was based on an optical filtration channel above the PV cells without a cooling channel (SYS-3). To investigate the optical filtration capabilities of the nano-ePCM dispersion, a performance metric known as the ‘spectral match’ (SM) was proposed. Results showed that all ePCM dispersions exhibited a SM > 70 % when the PCM cores were in their liquid phase and a SM > 30 % while in solid phase. As compared to SYS-2 and SYS-3, at the lowest investigated flowrate (0.0026 kg s<sup>−1</sup>), the proposed PV/T system exhibited mean cell temperatures lower by 5 and 10°while offering relative thermal exergy enhancements of 66 and 208 %, respectively. This was attributed to allowing the PV cells to operate at temperatures substantially lower than the dispersion outlet temperature to achieve both high-grade thermal outputs and enhanced PV efficiencies. This study paves the way for novel PV/T collectors that employ smart, multi-functional fluids offering superior electrical and thermal performance."

The zero-dimensional model does not rely on spatial resolution or time-dependent variables. The model consists of thermodynamic relations that analyze the energy and the exergy of the PVT system. The mathematical model is validated against an in-house experimental PVT system that consists of a polycrystalline (PV) module attached to a double series-parallel serpentine thermal collector (TC). This comparison confirms the accuracy of the zero-dimensional model by predicting the difference between inlet and outlet water temperatures as well as the surface temperature of PV with an average error of 0.13 and 1.80°C, respectively. Then, using the validated model, a parametric study is conducted to optimize various design and operation parameters such as mass flow rates, inlet temperature, solar irradiance and wind speed; hence to improve the overall performance of the system. The experimental results indicate that, a mass flow rate of 0.001 kg/s and an ambient inlet temperature provide the highest overall second law efficiency of 15.2%. Also, it is observed that the PVT system shows better performances in regions with relatively low ambient temperature yet high solar radiation."

Food waste, Salicornia bigelovii seed, and undigested sludge produced the highest bio-oil yield, 38.0 %, 35.3 %, and 32.5 %, respectively. The bio-oils from food waste and Salicornia bigelovii seed were rich in acidic compounds. The former has the highest calorific value (34.7 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>), while the latter is the lowest due to a significant amount of water (29.9 mass%). The biosolids produced bio-oil rich in alcohols and esters, turning it towards high alkalinity (pH > 9). The biochar from animal manure and biosolids has the lowest calorific value (<10.0 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>) and the least potential for soil amendment and carbon sequestration due to poor stability, low fixed carbon, and significantly high ash content in the feed (>39 mass%). The gas from digested biosolid has the highest calorific value (>38.9 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>), benefiting from the presence of high H<inf>2</inf> content (21.2 mass%). Analysis of the potential implementation of the eight feedstocks for pyrolysis in an arid region indicates that food waste is the most promising due to its superior bio-oil quality, higher conversion efficiency, abundant availability, and the possibility of low-cost drying."

This paper proposes a two-stage community home energy management system for microgrids. The first stage deals with the dynamic clustered community load scheduling scheme. Comparatively flatter power demand was attained using particle swarm optimization (PSO) incorporating user-defined constraints. The new arising or remaining peaks as a consequence of consumer constraints are catered to in the second stage. The second stage proposes a rule-based peak shaving management method for the photovoltaic (PV) systems that are connected to the grid and the battery energy storage systems. The proposed technique determines the dynamic demand and feed-in limits based on the estimations of the upcoming day's load demand and PV power profiles. Also, the study presents an optimal rule-based management technique for peak shaving of utility grid power that sets the charge/discharge day ahead schedules of the battery. For peak energy minimization, PSO is used to calculate the optimal inputs needed for implementing the appropriate rule-based management strategy.

Hence, the concept of the water-energy nexus has emerged as the best option to alleviate the gap between the demand and production of both water and power. This paper proposes a new approach for co-optimizing water and electric power systems by incorporating the energy-intensive equipment involved in water desalination and distribution. The proposed procedure leverages the energy flexibility of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination tracks. RO tracks can operate alternatively in conjunction with water network storage tanks with variable-speed pumps to optimal satisfy water demand at minimum energy and operating costs. The developed model takes into consideration the essential constraints of both the power and water systems to meet consumer demands. Further, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is proposed for the day-ahead operation of the two integrated systems. The simulation findings show that the suggested technique is successful in scheduling the energy-intensive equipment in the two systems to achieve a 26,993 per day savings compared to a 4.6% decrease in overall operating costs when compared to optimizing each system independently."

Then, the model is verified with theoretical and experimental results from the literature. A parametric study of various design and operating parameters, and material selection is carried out to optimize the overall performance. A net output voltage of 0.8 V is obtained at 150 mAcm-2 current density, which yields an overall efficiency of 75%. The results indicate that increasing the electrolyte thickness or operating temperature results in a lower net voltage output. Additionally, improving the performance of a fuel cell through the bipolar plate can be achieved by understanding the contribution of different parameters towards minimizing the pressure drop across the bipolar plate. It is found that implementing an optimized selection of fluid flow rate, channel width, channel depth, number of channels and current density minimize the pressure drop throughout the bipolar plate. Relative humidity has a significant effect on the pressure drop. Results indicate that increasing the relative humidity consequentially rises the pressure drop. Finally, the CFD simulation illustrates that the end-zones in the bipolar plate accumulates fluid due to the nature of stagnation at those locations. Thus, total pressure at those locations is the highest. One of the major contributions here is studying the effect of KOH concentration on the performance of the AFC at different operating temperatures. In addition, a wide range of design and operating parameters were analysed to understand their effect on the overall performance of the fuel cell."

One application that has stimulated many experimental studies is their use as green solvents in energy and heat storage.

Herein, for the first time, we combine molecular modeling and machine learning (ML) to develop a holistic tool that can map the thermal conductivity space of both ILs and DESs to bring their use as green solvents into industrial reality. Two molecular representations were used: the σ-profiles (σ<inf>p</inf>) and the critical properties (CPs).

    "abstract": "Recently, with the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources into microgrid ((Formula presented.) power electronics, distributed energy systems have gained popularity. However, low inertia reduces system frequency stability and anti-disturbance capabilities, exposing power quality to intermittency and uncertainty in photovoltaics or wind turbines. To ensure system stability, the virtual inertia control (VIC) is presented. This paper proposes two solutions to overcome the low inertia problem and the surplus in capacities resulting from renewable energy sources. The first solution employs superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), which can be deemed as an efficient solution for damping the frequency oscillations. Therefore, in this work, SMES that is managed by a simple proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) controller is utilized to overcome the low inertia. In the second solution, the hydrogen storage system is employed to maintain the stability of the microgrid by storing surplus power generated by renewable energy sources (RESs). Power-to-Power is a method of storing excess renewable energy as chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be utilized locally or delivered to a consumption node. The proposed (Formula presented.) operation demonstrates that the integration of the photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs), diesel engine generator (DEG), electrolyzer, micro gas turbine ((Formula presented.), and SMES is adequate to fulfill the load requirements under transient operating circumstances such as a low and high PV output power as well as to adapt to sudden changes in the load demand.

    "abstract": "Alkaline fuel cells (AFC) have proven to provide high power densities and can attain considerable lifetimes, thus making them a worthy competitor to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). The electrolytes are based on aqueous bases and are relatively inexpensive. The non-corrosive nature of their electrolyte facilitates diverse usage of various catalyst materials apart from platinum, thus enabling the mass production of low-cost fuel cells. This review provides a summarized overview of AFCs. It sheds light on its fundamental operational principles, the most recent research trends related to catalyst developments, its system components and stack designs, and also provides a brief performance analysis section that highlights how the performance of an AFC is impacted upon varying different system parameters (e.g. electrolyte concentration, electrolyte thickness, and operating temperatures). This parametric study has shown that increasing the electrolyte concentration from 1–61 mol/L results in an increase in the AFC's peak power density from 72.9 to 169 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, increasing the cell's operating temperatures from 243–283 K yields increased peak power densities from 112 to 140 W/m<sup>2</sup>. This is mainly attributed to the enhancement of the electrolyte's specific conductivity and the cell's overall electrochemical kinetics. Increasing the electrolyte thickness, however, decreases the performance of an AFC, where peak power densities fall from 123 to 66 W/m<sup>2</sup> when the thickness increases from 1 to 5 μm. This is a consequence of the increased internal resistances encountered by the hydroxyl ions as they migrate through the electrolyte."

Graphite-based phase change materials (GraPCMs) are prepared by stirring and sonicating graphite with different surfactants, including Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulfonate (SDBS), and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), in a liquid bio-based PCM. Based on the experiments, the thermal conductivity of the bio-based PCM is increased by 240% to 0.748 W/m⋅K and 218% to 0.70 W/m⋅K when mixed with graphite-SDBS and graphite-SDS, respectively, at a 5% mass fraction of graphite. The ratio of 1:3 graphite to surfactant at a 5% mass fraction of graphite results in the longest amount of time for GraPCM-SDBS and GraPCM-SDS to reach the reference temperature of 43 °C, with delays of 185 and 175 s, respectively. It is observed that increasing the concentration of surfactant leads to further delay in reaching the reference temperature in the case of GraPCM-SDS.

The most common PEMFC membranes are made of a perfluorinated sulfonic acid membrane (Nafion). This membrane exhibits excellent proton conductivity Under fully humid conditions and low temperatures (around 80°C). Thus, operating at higher temperatures is not recommended because it leads to membrane dehydration and drastically reduces its proton conductivity. This has negative effects on PEMFC systems and causes power deterioration. Therefore, several efforts have attempted to modify existing membranes by incorporating additives in various polymer matrices to develop Nafion-free membranes for PEMFCs. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be promising materials for fuel cells applications. They have the potential as proton carriers due to their enormous surface area, easy-to-tune pore size, and their high thermal stability.

    "abstract": "Power demand varies on a daily and seasonal basis. Responding to changing demands over time is challenging for energy suppliers as it causes expensive power plants to operate in high-demand seasons, usually summer, increasing the cost of electricity. Peak load shaving makes the load curve flatten by reducing the peak load and shifting it to times of lower demand, hence reducing the operation of expensive power plants. Hence, there is a need for large-scale and long-term ESS to store energy in the time of low-demand seasons for future utilization in the highest-demand ones. In this work, an energy management system (EMS) is developed to optimally manage a grid-connected pumped hydro storage (PHS) for peak shaving. The proposed model incorporates a dynamic economic dispatch (DED) over a study period of one year; hence, a DC power flow analysis considering transmission constraints is utilized to ensure a fast load flow estimation and a manageable simulation time. The framework can be adopted to assess the long-term profitability of PHS-utilizing GAMS as an optimization tool. Further, to draw conclusions that would suit the characteristics of the demand pattern. This analysis is essential to motivate the construction of new seasonal PHS plants due to the high construction costs they are identified with, especially in geographical areas where this technology is not yet considered or is hard to construct. The simulation results demonstrate that integrating 1500 MWh PHS reduced the operation of expensive thermal units by 1224 MWh annually. Further, a reduction in operation costs was recorded after integrating a PHS unit that ranged from 2.6 M to 22 M USD/year, depending on the storage capacity."

However, in multi-cell multi-band systems, interference issues can arise from resource sharing among multiple users, which limits the potential of NOMA. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we study a NOMA system where reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are employed across multiple cells with multiple users clusters. Specifically, we propose an optimization framework to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) through jointly designing the transmission beamformer at each base station, the RIS phase shifts and the corresponding binary selection matrix indicating which elements of the RIS should be used to serve a specific cell. Our optimization framework takes into account the minimum rate requirements of users, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding-based rate constraint, fairness among users as well as the maximum allowed transmission power. The resulting non-convex problem is solved by using an alternating optimization algorithm, wherein semidefinite programming (SDP), successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalty-based difference-of-convex (DC) programming are used to reach a solution. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms conventional orthogonal access in terms of EE performance, the achievable rate, and power consumption. Also, the results revealed the critical transmission power level for NOMA beyond which the EE starts decaying. Moreover, the proposed NOMA system shows a limited EE performance compared to the conventional orthogonal access as the number of clusters exceeds a certain limit."

One of the factors slowing down the adoption rate of EVs is the downtime required to charge the EV battery, during which the EV is idle. As a result, dynamic wireless charging (DWC) systems are gaining an increasing popularity by offering the advantage of on-the-move charging with no charging downtime. Yet, a major concern to DWC systems is the lateral misalignment (LM) of the vehicle, and hence the secondary coil, with respect to the primary one, and how it negatively affects the magnetic coupling process. To overcome this obstacle, double-D quadrature (DDQ) secondary coils are recommended in the literature, to help improve the coupling at a wider misalignment range. This work evaluates the performance of this DDQ secondary-side coil against a double-D (DD) primary-side transmitter, by studying the variations in the output voltage, current and power levels at different misalignment values against variations in the coupling coefficient. This helps explain the differences in coupling performance of the DD-DDQ inductive link during left-side and right-side misalignments."

To obtain practical results, different uncertainties associated with EVs and PV generation are considered using stochastic optimization. The uncertainties are considered using the sample average approximation method by applying the Monte Carlo Simulation. Hence, a mixed integer linear programming problem is formulated and is solved using CPLEX to minimize the expected day-ahead operating cost of the parking lot. Several Scenario studies are simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieved up to 24% reduction in operating costs on weekdays."

Performance of the three PV/T configurations was comparatively analyzed upon varying the PCM core material, mass flowrate, channel depth, inlet and ambient temperatures, and wind speed. The utilized dispersion exhibited a 73.8% spectral match with Si PV cells, thus hinting at the effective spectral filtration capabilities of the designed fluid. When compared to similar PV/T configurations from different literatures, total exergy efficiency enhancements of 43.2%, 76.8%, and 2.6% were evident for the coupled, decoupled, and partially coupled systems, respectively. In addition, results have shown that the thermally decoupled system outperforms the coupled and partially coupled systems in terms of thermal performance but exhibits the poorest performance when superior electrical performance is desired."

    "abstract": "As transportation electrification increases globally, new technologies emerged in the past few years to meet the growth of the electricity demand. Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESS) offer versatile solutions, aiding distribution systems with reactive power, renewables integration, and peak shaving. An MESS can be utilized to serve electric vehicles (EVs) in different parking lots (PLs), in addition to supplying power to the grid during overloads. The task of multiple stationary units can be achieved using MESS at a relatively lower cost. This paper proposes an MESS owned by multiple PLs sharing the same geographical area and sharing its capital and operational cost. The main objective of the proposed approach is to dispatch the MESS in conjunction with optimal EVs’ charging coordination to minimize operational costs and address the extra demand of PLs. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated and solved. Considering electricity price variations and EVs uncertainties, three different case studies are performed to highlight the efficiency and success of the proposed approach. The simulation results in a huge reduction in the total operation cost and the savings reach up to 27.51% in comparison with the base case."

    "abstract": "Abstract: Along with the various features for implementing the Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid (HMG), this article proposes an approach for optimal allocation of multiple capacitors which are investigated in a proposed modeling based on the IEEE 14-bus distribution system. The power quality of the HMG has been investigated during the urgent intermittent of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Reactive Power Compensation (RPC) methods. Moreover, the investigation has been achieved in the presence of unbalanced loads and nonlinear loads with maximum and minimum demand scenarios. To cope with the power quality concerns in the studied cases, the fixed capacitor bank as an RPC system in Medium Voltage (MV) level load buses has been utilized. Although the performance indices of the power quality improved in MV-level buses, the Low Voltage (LV) level load buses still endure extensive operation performance deteriorations caused by unbalanced loads. Therefore, in this article, a compensation scheme applied in LV-level load buses and MV-level buses has been proposed consistent with the power flow computations. The Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO) algorithm is implemented to optimize both the size and location of capacitor banks over different voltage levels with high accuracy. The comprehensive assessment and discussion of the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of utilizing the proposed compensation scheme in both MV-level and LV-level load buses. Hence, the power quality is not only enhanced but also the installation cost is reduced. The complete model of the studied system has been validated using MATLAB/ Simulink. Article Highlights: The reactive power compensation method is used to improve the power quality in a hybrid AC-DC microgrid.The applied RPC method verifies using the MOGWO algorithm to optimize both the location and size of multiple capacitor banks.Power quality challenges and future research trends are debated."

A better understanding of the behavior of AWE and the factors that influence its performance has been presented through a detailed discussion of the experimental results. The results have shown that reducing the gap size between electrodes improves AWE efficiency, however this relation is not monotonic and after a critical gap size the performance starts deteriorating.

The increasing concern about harmful environmental effects sparked by the extensive application of nonrenewable energy sources necessitates the contribution of bioenergy to the global renewable energy mix. Bioenergy is produced by the oxidation of biomass substrates, which are categorized as first-generation (edible food sources), second-generation (nonedible sources), and third-generation (biomass derived from algae). Although rapid growth, abundant existence, cultivability in nonarable lands and low processing energy provide algal substrates with an edge over others, their large-scale conversion processes still require extensive development. Biomass can be transformed into bioenergy by a myriad of conversion processes that are biological, chemical, and thermal in nature. Biofuels such as bioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel can be produced by fermentation (biological process), anaerobic digestion (biological process), and transesterification (chemical process), respectively. Thermal conversion processes include gasification and combustion of biomass to produce energy. Additionally, several pretreatment methods to condition the flow of the biomass substrate, thereby ensuring increased conversion efficiency of the process, have been discussed in the paper. Although hybrid conversion processes provide the luxury of broader biomass feedstock intake, increased processing time and larger production area are some of the challenges that require unraveling to attract investors."

This paper presents the case study of a PV system installation in the building of the Pakistani Association Dubai (PAD), UAE, to reduce the high energy consumption of the institution. The proposed approach in this study utilizes several inputs, including the available roof areas, the orientation of the building, annual electricity bills, and the weather historical data among others, to size the PV system for the two main buildings in the PAD center.

Several case studies are presented based on roof availability. The results show a significant reduction in the annual electricity consumption hence the bills. When the two PAD buildings', available space is fully utilized, annual costs are reduced by 17.4%, whereas when only 25% of the space is utilized, costs are reduced by 3.0%.

All types of PS scenarios can lead to power loss and hot spots in the PV system due to module mismatch and heating of shaded cells. To mitigate the power loss that occurs due to PS, it is imperative to detect PS and its characteristics, such as the number of shaded modules and the associated shading factor (SF), in a reliable manner. This paper proposes a three-step framework to detect and locate PS, the number of shaded modules, and the SF in the PV system using a random forest (RF)-based approach. The proposed approach utilizes independent string current and voltage measurements to distinguish different PS scenarios. This approach allows for a scalable data acquisition through an uncoupled modeling scheme. PS, the number of shaded modules and the SF are deduced with accuracies of 99.5%, 92.3%, 90.2%, respectively. Further, the proposed approach is validated through two testing tiers, and its ability to detect multiple PS scenarios in a PV system has been highlighted. The results observed through different PS scenarios confirm the high reliability and demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed RF-based approach."

All the modified membranes generally demonstrated very good proton conductivity values in the range of 10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm at room temperature.

The ionic conductivities of the prepared membrane samples were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The CS is one of the attractive choices of green and sustainable membrane materials in PEMs because of its chemical tunability and cost-effectiveness. The membranes were prepared by solution casting followed by a solvent evaporating procedure. The low proton conductivity of pristine CS biopolymer was enhanced by the incorporation of ILs in the membrane framework. Tensile testing confirmed the excellent membrane mechanical integrity. A significant enhancement in the membranes’ characteristics was observed upon the introduction of [DEMA][OMs] into its matrix. The experimental results showed enhanced proton conductivities of the prepared membranes along with enhanced flexibility.

Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices can be utilized to improve the voltage profile and stability in the presence of large wind farms. This study presents a comprehensive techno-economic assessment for different FACTS devices used with wind farms. In the technical assessment, the improved voltage (IV) index is presented to quantify the contribution of the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) devices with the focus on the improvement of the voltage levels during different types of faults. In the economic assessment, a cost comparison between the chosen FACTS devices is presented, where a cost related (CR) index is proposed which considers the investment cost in the FACTS device and the minimum revenue that could be obtained as a result of FACTS installation to keep the wind farm connected as a result of the voltage improvement during faults. In addition, guidelines to calculate the threshold for annual additional energy from the wind farm and its revenue needed to compensate for the FACTS device total cost are presented. To consider the environmental impact, the role of the FACTS devices on reducing CO2 emissions, and the associated carbon credit certificates, is considered. Finally, to combine both assessments, a new weighted techno-economic (TEI) index is presented which combines the IV and the CR indices obtained from the technical and economic assessments, respectively. This index will assist system operators in selecting the optimal device, where a breakeven point serving as the criterion for selecting the best device based on the proposed approach. The results show that the TEI index for the proposed system indicates that the STATCOM is considered a preferable solution when the focus is towards the economic weight.

In this study, a technical weight of 0.8364 (economic weight of 0.1636) is the turning point between the two devices. Below this weight, the STATCOM is more suitable for installation and above this weight, the UPFC is a preferred option."

This paper presents details of the design, prototyping and testing of a dual-active HESMS, in which a Li-ion battery and a pack of supercapacitors are connected through DC/DC converters to supply the energy requirements of the EV motor. In particular, as supercapacitors have higher power densities and can provide sudden current peaks, they are used to supply loads during high power demands such as during acceleration. Simulation and testing results reveal that, by integrating supercapacitors in a HESMS, the State of Charge (SOC) of the EV battery reduces slowly as compared to solely supplying the motor's requirements.

    "abstract": "The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is one of the most promising technologies to achieve high power density at room temperature. Many studies have been conducted to improve its performance by optimizing the operating conditions. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of membrane thickness under various pertinent operating conditions on the performance of the DMFC using the two-level factorial design method. The operating conditions include methanol concentration, temperature, cathode flow rate, and backpressure. Two models have been developed for the maximum power density of the DMFC using factorial design. The first model is a function of membrane thickness, temperature, cathode flow rate, and backpressure, while the second model is a function of membrane thickness and methanol concentration. The effects of membrane thickness with the other operating conditions are analyzed from the parameters of the developed models. It has been shown that increasing the membrane thickness decreases the maximum obtained power density. Increasing the membrane thickness along with methanol concentration or backpressure increases the obtained power density. The negative effect of membrane thickness increases with the rise of temperature or the lowering of the cathode flow rate. Using the factorial design, two other models are developed for the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the DMFC. The effect of the membrane thickness is always positive on the OCV."

    "abstract": "Energy hubs (EHs) have substantially paved the way for the coordinated operation of various energy carriers, converters, and storage. However, the establishment of optimal planning and operation of the EH include several challenges, e.g., the stochastic nature of non-dispatchable generation assets, obtaining a satisfactory performance from the storage assets with reasonable energy and power density costs, and long-term load growth. Accordingly, this paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimal resource allocation and operation approach for multiple smart energy hubs-based microgrids. The first stage optimizes the location of each EH and different assets' capacities. On the other hand, the second stage optimizes the charging/discharging rates of each asset and parking lot power. These microgrids combine renewable energy sources. Moreover, for research gap and unlike existing research, the cooperative operation of hybrid storage systems (i.e., solar-powered compressed air energy storage, hydrogen storage systems, battery energy storage systems, thermal energy storage systems) along with plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) has been investigated. Furthermore, annual load growth and price-based demand response (PBDR) are employed in this study. The simulation results demonstrate that the controlled charging/discharging of the PEVs reduces the total annualized cost by 5.49%, while the operation and emission costs are reduced by 21.3% and 19.86%, respectively. Furthermore, employing PBDR has led to a reduction of 10.1% in capital and operational costs."

The lack of a standardized and efficient method for identifying supercapacitor parameters has a definite effect on widespread adoption of supercapacitors, especially in high-power density applications like electric vehicle regenerative braking. The study focuses on parameterizing the Zubieta model for supercapacitors, which involves identifying seven parameters using a hybrid metaheuristic gradient-based optimization (MGBO) approach. The effectiveness of the MGBO method is compared to the existing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and to the following algorithms proposed and developed in this work: ‘modified MGBO’ (M-MGBO) and two PSO variations—one combining PSO and M-MGBO and the other incorporating a local escaping operator (LCEO) with PSO. Metaheuristic- and gradient-based algorithms are both affected by problems associated with locally optimal results and with issues related to enforcing constraints/boundaries on solution values. This work develops the above-mentioned innovations to the MGBO and PSO algorithms for addressing such issues. Rigorous experimentation considering various types of input excitation provides results indicating that hybrid PSO-MGBO and PSO-LCEO outperform traditional PSO, showing improvements of 51% and 94%, respectively, while remaining comparable to M-MGBO. These hybrid approaches effectively estimate Zubieta model parameters. The findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in enhancing precision and effectiveness in supercapacitor model parameterization."

However, when it comes to developing an optimal operational scheme, the interaction of these different energy sectors, along with the uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources (RES) and the driving patterns of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners, would pose a challenge.

This increasing EV penetration is anticipated to result in a growing electricity demand to address the EV charging requirements.

While several attempts have been made to develop predictive models for the estimation of the heat capacity of ILs in their liquid phase, none so far have been reported for the ILs’ solid crystal phase. This is particularly important for applications where ILs will be used for thermal energy storage in the solid phase. For the first time, a model has been developed and used for the prediction of crystal phase heat capacity based on extending and modifying a previously developed hybrid group contribution model (GCM) for liquid phase heat capacity. A comprehensive database of over 5000 data points with 71 unique crystal phase ILs, comprising 42 different cations and 23 different anions, was used for parameterization and testing. This hybrid model takes into account the effect of the anion core, cation core, and subgroups within cations and anions, in addition to the derived indirect parameters that reflect the effects of branching and distribution around the core of the IL. According to the results, the developed GCM can reliably predict the crystal phase heat capacity with a mean absolute percentage error of 6.78%.

Alternatively, numerical analysis can be employed to generalize and incorporate significant factors into the dust deposition model, thereby enhancing the applicability of the optimized model. This study aims to determine the optimum cleaning frequency that maximizes power gain while minimizing cleaning costs, utilizing numerical analysis to model the dust deposition rate. An optimization model is developed to determine the cleaning intervals based on surrounding conditions dynamically. The model minimizes the sum of cleaning costs and revenue loss due to soiling. The decline in photovoltaic efficiency from soiling is modeled using empirical equations in terms of dust deposition rate, derived through regression analysis from numerical results. The model is validated using a case study from the literature and then applied to a more generalized scenario.

To examine the impact of the thermic condition on the pyrolysis products (bio-oil, biochar, and gas), the experiments have been conducted at three different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 °C). This pioneering study revealed that the co-feed bio-oil is acidic (pH 3.76-4.39) and has a high energy content (HHV 32.29-36.29 MJ/kg) that surpasses most woody biomass. The produced biochar was chemically stable, high in ash (40.09-47.62 wt %), high in fixed carbon (30.12-38.12 wt %), highly alkaline (pH 9.37-10.69), and low in HHV (16.30-17.2 MJ/kg). Increased pyrolysis temperature enhances biochar stability and fixed carbon, thus benefiting long-term carbon sequestration if applied in the soil. However, due to its high alkalinity, the application of this biochar in naturally alkaline sandy soils, such as in coastal deserts, requires careful monitoring. The hydrogen content in the gaseous phase significantly improves with rising temperature, reaching HHV = 24.12 MJ/kg at 600 °C, due to the enhanced ash catalytic effect.

Floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems present an attractive solution for harnessing solar energy, particularly where land availability is constrained. These systems offer benefits such as conserving water and land while delivering higher power output compared to conventional terrestrial PV systems. While the advantages of FPV systems are generally recognized, research on their specific characteristics remains limited. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of FPV technology and its potential applications, particularly in Pakistan. By comparing ground-mounted and FPV systems, the study explores the economic, technological, and environmental implications of FPV adoption in regions with similar geographical profiles. The analysis highlights not only the cooling impact of water, which enhances the efficiency of FPV systems, but also other key aspects such as cost-effectiveness, site preparation, and environmental impact.

Residential ESS not only mitigates these challenges but also assists in mitigating irregular PV power issues. Different methodologies have been developed to construct models assessing the techno-economic benefits of integrating ESS with PV systems. Nevertheless, these approaches do not account for PV-ESS operation with feed-in-tariff (FiT) incentives, different electricity rate structures, and the lifetime model of ESS. This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) suitable for rooftop PV installations. The EMS incorporates a temperature model and optimizes scheduling to regulate the power output of the PV/ESS in response to changes/needs in electricity demand. In addition, tactical information exchange between the ESS and the utility grid is facilitated by Link 16 wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, hybrid gated recurrent unit (GRU) and graph convolutional network (GCN) model is introduced for predicting PV power and electricity load. Consumer electricity data, PV data, and tariffs are utilized in the proposed study to examine the impact of MESS on electricity charges. The impact of multi-ESS (MESS) on the objective function is evaluated using the optimization model. Simulation results on a typical system show that the proposed approach significantly enhances battery performance. By the end of the year, the SOC reaches 84.78 % for the proposed MESS and 84.64 % for the DESS. The results reveal that the proposed approach yields 22 % cost savings compared to a dual ESS system and 24 % cost reduction compared to a single ESS. Moreover, the elevated packet delivery ratio values corresponding to higher signal-to-noise ratio levels signify enhanced reliability and superior communication performance. The impact of jamming attacks on battery consumption employing additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is compared with AWGN and single-tone, and AWGN and multi-tone. The results show that when dealing solely with AWGN, less power is needed to filter out noise."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are at the forefront of sustainable electricity generation technologies, yet they exhibit relatively low efficiency. Typically, less than 20 % of the solar energy absorbed is converted into electrical energy, with the remainder converts into heat. This heat increases the PV panel's operating temperature, negatively impacting its efficiency and life expectancy. To mitigate this, a novel approach using multi-layered phase change materials (PCMs) has been examined in this study. The approach involves integrating organic PCMs (OPCMs) with metallic PCMs (MPCMs), enhancing PV panel cooling efficiency by attaching the multi-layer PCM to the panel's rear. This study, employing ANSYS FLUENT software's solidification and melting model, explores the impact of multi PCM layers thickness and total multi layers thickness on PV cell temperature and electrical efficiency. The analysis reveals that a multi-layered PCMs configuration with a thickness ratio of 15:85 between MPCM (CERROLOW-117® alloy) and OPCM (RT44) significantly decreases temperature rise in PV cells, resulting in a temperature drop of 59.6 °C. This improvement boosts PV panel performance by an average of 35.8 % compared to panels lacking cooling systems during peak sun hours under hot climate conditions characterized by ambient temperatures of 40 °C and high solar radiation exceeding 1000 W/m². This suggests that a carefully optimized PCM layering approach could markedly improve PV system efficiency, offering a practical solution to the overheating problem and extending the operational life of PV installations."

However, the energy management (EM) of the MMGs became a complex and strenuous task with high penetration of renewable energy resources due to the stochastic nature of these resources along with the load fluctuations. In this regard, this paper aims to solve the EM problem of the MMGs with the optimal inclusion of photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbines (WTs), and biomass systems. In this regard, this paper proposed an enhanced Jellyfish Search Optimizer (EJSO) for solving the EM of MMGs for the 85-bus MMGS system to minimize the total cost, and the system performance improvement concurrently. The proposed algorithm is based on the Weibull Flight Motion (WFM) and the Fitness Distance Balance (FDB) mechanisms to tackle the stagnation problem of the conventional JSO technique. The performance of the EJSO is tested on standard and CEC 2019 benchmark functions and the obtained results are compared to optimization techniques. As per the obtained results, EJSO is a powerful method for solving the EM compared to other optimization method like Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO), Dandelion Optimizer (DO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and the standard Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO). The obtained results reveal that the EM solution by the suggested EJSO can reduce the cost by 44.75% while the system voltage profile and stability are enhanced by 40.8% and 10.56%, respectively."

Particularly, fuel cells that use a proton exchange membrane (PEM) have been gaining special attention due to their favorable low pollutant generation, small size, all-solid structure, high power density, and silent operation. Currently, the conventional PEM used in fuel cells is Nafion of DuPont. However, despite its high proton conductivity, Nafion has some drawbacks, including the high cost, liquid fuel permeability, and poor conductivity at high temperatures. These limitations necessitate the urgent substitution of Nafion with alternative sustainable PEMs. Natural polymers emerged as promising PEM materials. Despite the high interest in natural polymer-based PEMs, the literature currently lacks a review that comprehensively summarizes where these materials stand on the application as PEMs for fuel cells. Therefore, this review thoroughly explores and evaluates the potential of natural polymers, specifically chitosan, alginate, cellulose, starch, and lignin, as well as natural/natural and natural/synthetic polymer hybrids as PEM materials for fuel cell applications. To evaluate the performance of the natural polymer-based membranes as PEMs, proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, power density, methanol permeability, and selectivity were used throughout the paper as critical performance parameters. Furthermore, this review also highlights some limitations of the studied natural polymer-based PEMs as well as the underexplored potential of other natural polymers, such as collagen, starch, and polylactic acid. The aim of this review is to guide future research in the area of clean energy production toward developing sustainable and eco-friendly PEMs for use in fuel cells."

However, under external disturbances and parameters variation, the speed regulator performance may degrade. This work proposes solutions for tuning the PI gains of the speed regulator by using a high-gain adaptive controller, which automatically adjusts the PI controller gains based on the motor speed tracking error. To overcome gains drift caused by sensor noise, potentially leading to instability, modifications like the sigma, dead-zone, and epsilon method are applied to the adaptive law. Preliminary simulations and experimental results show that the epsilon modification-based high-gain controller outperforms the sigma and dead zone modifications for the induction motor drive system. Therefore, rigorous experimental validation of the epsilon-modified high-gain controller on an indirect field-oriented induction motor drive system is demonstrated for the following cases: square wave speed reference tracking, external disturbance rejection, detuning, field weakening, as well as different initial conditions for gains. Finally, the controller's performance is also investigated on a prototype electric vehicle (EV) traction system that consists of a 2.2 KW induction motor powered by a 400V, 6.6 A.h Li-ion battery bank. The experimental results on the prototype EV traction system validate a better speed tracking performance as compared to the fixed gains PI controller while requiring almost the same amount of current."

    "abstract": "Currently, there is highly concentrated attention given to microgrid energy management, particularly due to the significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy resources (RERs) such as photovoltaic units and wind turbines, as well as the growing reliance on electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce environmental pollution. Considering uncertainties, which are associated with solar irradiance and wind speed, can increase the ability to achieve proper energy management. In addition to that, considering the smart grid's role in the electricity market as a price maker and the unpredictable behavior of EVs, these considerations aim to minimize costs and maximize profits for microgrids. The main contribution of this paper is studying the impact of increasing the charging tariff of EVs in the presence of different types of RERs on charging behavior, maximizing the profit of the microgrid, and reducing the total energy purchased from the wholesale market. For this purpose, a metaheuristic-based optimization problem called Gorilla Troops optimizer (GTO) is employed to optimally allocate the RERs and the EV charging stations. The results demonstrate that increasing the charging tariff without RERs or with only one source of RERs results in the charging of EVs following an uncontrollable strategy. Hence, the cost of purchasing energy from the utility increases. On the other hand, compared to the base case, integrating EV charging stations with multi- type RERs resulted in the profit increasing by 61.92 % and the total energy purchased from the wholesale market decreasing by 24.98 %. Moreover, the waiting time at the charging station will be reduced shortly; the annual installment of multi- type RERs decreased by 31.25 % compared with considering only one source of RERs, and the charging strategy of EVs followed the controllable charging strategy."

Incorporating lignin into zirconium silicate at room temperature has significantly increased the zirconium silicate's proton conductivity by two orders of magnitude, from 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−2</sup> S/cm. Furthermore, the addition of ionic liquids caused more enhancement in proton conductivity. Two ionic liquids were studied in this work, 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide and 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide). The incorporation of 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide demonstrated the highest proton conduction at room temperature, reaching 0.106 S/cm with an ion exchange capacity of 1.67 meq/g. This most conductive membrane has also demonstrated a slight decrease in proton conductivity (10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm) at 150°C showing a high anhydrous conductivity. The membranes’ conductivity was shown to be stable over time as well. The water uptake and swelling ratio results showed improved water retention and dimensional stability. Additional characterization techniques demonstrated positive effect of lignin and ionic liquids inclusion into zirconium silicate on morphology and mechanical properties.

Indeed, the arbitrary distribution of FCSs can detrimentally affect the efficiency of traffic movement. Thus, this paper presents a planning methodology aimed at optimizing the allocation of FCSs within large-scale transportation networks. The energy system proposed includes an autonomous photovoltaic (PV)-powered FCS based on a DC microgrid, supplemented by a stationary battery energy storage system for backup power. The behavior of EVs within the traffic flow is modeled using a realistic traffic simulation software called Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Advanced Road Telematics (DYNASMAT). The conflicting objectives of minimizing total annual costs and EV average waiting time at stations are addressed through multi-objective optimization. To solve this optimization problem, the GAMS software is employed. A transportation network with 92 nodes and 284 links is utilized to test the proposed approach. The proposed autonomous PV-powered FCS is compared with Natural Gas-fired Distributed Generators (NGDG)-powered FCS. The simulation results show that while the NGDG-powered FCS exhibits higher emissions, the autonomous PV-powered equivalent operates emission-free.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is characterized by its efficiency and environmental benefits. The prediction and optimization of hydrogen production rates (HPRs) in PEMWE systems is difficult and still challenging because of the complexity of the system as well as the operational parameters. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) appears to be effective in optimization within the energy sector. Hence, this work employs the artificial neural network (ANN) to develop a model that accurately predicts HPR in PEMWE setups. A novel approach is introduced by employing the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation (LMBP) algorithm for training the ANN. This model is designed to predict HPR based on critical operational parameters, including anode and cathode areas (mm<sup>2</sup>), cell voltage (V) and current (A), water flow rate (mL/min), power (W), and temperature (K). The optimized ANN configuration features an architecture with 7 input nodes, two hidden layers of 64 neurons each, and a single output node. The performance of the ANN model was evaluated against conventional regression models using key metrics: mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), and mean absolute error (MAE). The findings of this study reveal that the developed ANN model significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.9989 and an MAE of 0.012. In comparison, random forest (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9795), linear regression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9697), and support vector machines (R<sup>2</sup> = − 0.4812) show lower predictive accuracy, underscoring the ANN model's superior performance. This work demonstrates the efficiency of the LMBP in enhancing hydrogen production forecasts and sets a foundation for future improvements in PEMWE efficiency. By enabling precise control and optimization of operational parameters, this study contributes to the broader goal of advancing green hydrogen production as a viable and scalable alternative to fossil fuels, offering both immediate and long-term benefits to sustainable energy initiatives."

In response to these concerns, this study focuses on a green building project that aims to meet its power requirements through renewable energy sources. Various renewable energy resources will be evaluated, considering the merits and drawbacks of each technology, to identify the most suitable option for the building under investigation. Additionally, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis will be conducted, including calculations of electrical needs such as cooling load, lighting load, and equipment load. A customized power calculator will also be developed for application in similar projects. The ultimate objective of this study is to achieve complete autonomy from the electric grid by utilizing renewable energy resources, transforming the building into a green building. The results indicate that at an outside temperature of 22 °C, the total heat gain decreases from 157.3 to 39 kW, reducing the total cost of electricity from 20,000 to 5100 AED/year. Conversely, at an outside temperature of 50 °C, the total heat gain increases from 157.3 to 196 kW, raising the total cost of electricity from 20,000 to 26,000 AED/year. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of outside temperature on the building's energy requirements and costs, underscoring the importance of considering temperature variations in energy efficiency and cost optimization strategies."

The proposed system uses LHP to move the heat load from the photovoltaic (PV) panel surface facing the Sun to a radiator surface where heat is radiated to the sky and dissipated to the surroundings by convection. The LHP allows heat removal from PV panel surface to the radiator surface with negligible temperature difference. Based on selected PV parameters and conditions, the proposed LHP-radiator cooling system achieves a peak temperature reduction of over 10 °C, leading to a 4.6 % enhancement in PV electrical efficiency compared to the reference efficiency.

This paper proposes a novel robust self-adaptive hill-climbing search (SA-HCS) algorithm based on optimal circular search zone for solar MPPT strategy. Initially, an open-circuit voltage estimation (OC-VE) strategy is proposed, followed by the implementation of the SA-HCS algorithm for a hybrid tracking approach. The proposed MPPT strategy uses large, variable, or adjustable step sizes, confirming efficient tracking by covering up to 90% of the search area bidirectionally. This is achieved by deploying an optimized circular curve synthesis, enabling rapid response. In the remaining search region, a small voltage step width is used to reduce steady-state oscillations near the maximum power point (MPP). The SA-HCS algorithm utilizes a universal circle equation to determine the appropriate perturbation step size based on the location of the operating power and OCV points, eliminating the need for prior-tuned perturbation step widths and calculations. The SA-HCS algorithm’s tracking performance is verified using MATLAB/Simulink, considering various solar irradiation conditions and real environmental data from the Benban Solar Park in Upper Egypt. As well, a comprehensive comparison with other counterpart HCS algorithms is investigated. Therefore, the proposed SA-HCS algorithm exhibits a minimal steady-state oscillations (1.2%), rapid settling time (12 ms), and excellent overall system efficiency (99.8%)."

    "abstract": "The production of clean and renewable energy at an affordable cost is becoming a key global sustainability goal. With this objective in sight, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM FCs) have become leaders in the race for clean energy generation. PEM FCs utilize a proton-conductive membrane, serving as the electrolyte, to generate electricity from pure hydrogen and produce water as the only side product. Recently, there has been a need to replace the gold standard PEM, Nafion, due to its high cost and deteriorated performance at high temperatures. This work reports the synthesis of conductive, highly elastic, and low-cost membranes for potential use in PEM FCs. The developed membranes were composed of the sustainable materials: 1) marine-derived collagen and chitosan, which can be extracted from fish waste, 2) the green solvent ionic liquid (IL), and 3) the biocompatible plasticizer polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this study, 4 membrane samples were prepared while varying the amount of the plasticizer PEG known to improve conductivity via ion-pair dissociation. The results showed that the membranes were highly elastic with conductivity increasing proportionally to PEG content. The best performing membrane had a conductivity of 0.00112 S/cm. However, although having a good conductivity, it remained lower than that of Nafion (0.1 S/cm). Therefore, future work to further improve the membrane's conductivity can include adjusting the weight percentages of the components and hydrating the membrane before testing. Furthermore, evaluation of the membranes' performance at high temperatures can be performed to assess their potential use in high temperature PEMs."

    "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are among the promising alternatives for clean energy generation, especially when hydrogen is the fuel used. Their operation is still faced with several challenges, and one of them is water accumulation in the cathode compartment. If PEMFCs are operated at temperatures above the boiling point of water, a significant obstacle would be eliminated due to the formation of water in the vapor phase. This prevents water from accumulating in the liquid phase which causes flooding. Therefore, this work aims to develop a novel composite membrane based on zirconium silicate (ZrSiO<inf>4</inf>) and Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) for such high-temperature operation. The composite membrane was synthesized using solution casting, and its structural and chemical properties were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The ZrSiO<inf>4</inf>/PVDF membrane demonstrated a maximum proton conductivity of 2.14 × 10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm at room temperature with 8 wt% ZrSiO<inf>4</inf>, along with a water uptake value of 43.85 %.

The experiments were conducted using pure gasoline and a hydrogen-gasoline blend at a constant speed of 1000 rpm, a throttle position of 50 %, and a fixed gasoline injection quantity of 6 mg per cycle. The hydrogen flow rate was incrementally increased in steps of 2 L per minute until the knock onset was observed. Intake air pressure was varied from 100 kPa to 112 kPa, while intake air temperature was adjusted from room temperature to 65 °C. The results indicated that brake thermal efficiency decreased from 10.43 % to 3.28 % with an increase in intake air pressure but increased to 15.26 % with a rise in intake air temperature. Combustion analysis revealed that peak in-cylinder pressure decreased from 22.77 bar to 21.22 bar with higher intake air pressure but increased to 25.69 bar with elevated intake air temperature. Additionally, carbon monoxide emissions decreased, whereas carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions increased with higher intake air temperature. In contrast, increasing intake air pressure exhibited the opposite trend. Cyclic variations were found to increase with intake air pressure and decrease with intake air temperature, with the coefficient of variation for peak pressure remaining below 10 % in all test cases. Engine performance improved with the addition of hydrogen to the fuel mixture. At a hydrogen flow rate of 8 L per minute, the average in-cylinder temperature, carbon dioxide emissions, and nitrogen oxide emissions were 884.34 °C, 7.2 %, and 172 ppm, respectively. Moreover, increasing intake air pressure and retarding spark timing raised the hydrogen knock limit to 14 and 18 L per minute, respectively, compared to the original limit of 8 L per minute.

A robust control technique is designed for regulating the currents and voltages within the system. Conventional sliding mode controllers (SMCs) are prone to chattering, and while the inclusion of a super-twisting component mitigates this issue, it introduces windup problems. To address these challenges, we propose a conditioned-based super-twisting SMC (CST-SMC), which effectively resolves the windup issue. The controller gains are optimized using the grey wolf optimization algorithm, and global stability is demonstrated through Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed system is simulated in MATLAB and experimentally validated using a Delfino F28379D-based hardware-in-the-loop setup. Numerical results show that the proposed CST-SMC has a faster rise time (0.0564 sec), less overshoot (0.00389), and a shorter settling time (0.4256 sec) compared to the conventional ST-SMC, which has a slower rise time (0.137 sec), greater overshoot (0.38095), and a longer settling time (3.8071 sec).

Solid biomass, such as pellets, has gained traction in Europe. Derived from organic materials like wood and crops, pellets offer an increasingly popular and sustainable alternative to coal for heat and power generation, with global production rising quickly and projected to continue growing into the far future. Pellet production is a comprehensive process. Feedstock preparation, processing treatments (mechanical, thermochemical, biological), and additives are essential to optimize feedstock properties. The feedstock is then pelletized using pellet mills, and the machine specifications and manufacturing parameters applied can significantly influence costs and product quality. The literature on life cycle assessments of pellets has shown that replacing coal with pellets can reduce various emissions and improve the environmental footprint of energy production. Because of their superior properties and emission profiles compared to agro-pellets (agriculture biomass pellets), Wood pellets dominate the pellet market as a substitute for coal in residential and commercial heating and industrial power generation. Despite their growing appeal, pellet consumption remains concentrated in specific regions, with Europe and China being the main regions reporting wide-scale pellet use. This paper provides an in-depth insight into pellets, encompassing their production, properties, applications, environmental implications, current market dynamics, future challenges, and relevant policies. Currently, wood pellets remain superior to other forms of pellets, and with sustainable forestry practices allowing greater wood harvest rates, it is expected and recommended to increase wood pellet production and consumption, especially in the heating sector. Agro-pellets should also be explored as technology improves, although their use might be restricted to when there is excessive biomass nearby if they keep underperforming relative to wood pellets. With a cleaner pollutant profile, carbon–neutral combustion, and increasingly competitive prices, biomass pellets are one of the most promising sustainable solutions to the world’s growing energy demands."

Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (Re-ZABs) emerged as a viable alternative for consumer electronics and electric vehicles, offering extended operational life and improved safety features. Recent advancements in Re-ZAB technology have been focusing on enhancing key components, such as air cathodes, zinc (Zn) anodes, and gas diffusion membranes, to improve energy storage capacity and battery lifespan. However, widespread commercial adoption remains hindered by persistent challenges, including dendrite formation, Zn anode passivation, corrosion, and limited charge-discharge cycles. Additionally, the slow kinetics of oxygen electrochemical reactions (oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)), and the interaction of oxygen with battery components present significant technical barriers. The development of durable and efficient oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for advancing Re-ZABs and related energy conversion technologies, such as fuel cells and water-splitting systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ZAB fundamentals, covering the transition from primary ZABs (Pr-ZABs) to rechargeable systems, alongside strategies to enhance battery efficiency and rechargeability. Particular attention is given to addressing Zn anode challenges, improving air cathodes, and evaluating the latest progress in unifunctional, bifunctional, and trifunctional electrocatalysts, including noble metal, transition metal, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based, and carbon-based materials.

    "abstract": "To address the pressing concerns surrounding electric vehicle (EV) range anxiety and energy availability, accurate prediction and coordination of the EV energy demand is vital. Whilst existing EV demand predictors rely on traffic simulators or local charging datasets, their effectiveness may be limited by a lack of actual EV driving data, hindering their scalability across different geographic regions. This study proposes a data-driven approach for EV demand prediction using both machine learning (ML) and statistical analysis, utilizing vehicular traffic flow data based on data collected on 250 EV trips across Dubai, UAE. The 250-trip data are used to obtain a trip-wise energy consumption model using SAS software, resulting in the simplified model consisting of the trip length variable, the trip duration variable and the average altitude of the trip variable. Furthermore, the data are then used to train various ML models including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forests (RF), and deep learning (DL) models, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the trip-wise energy consumption. The performance metrics for both training and testing of various ML and DL algorithms reveal a stark contrast, as the models fit the training data exceptionally well but generalize poorly to unseen data. The decline in performance across all models from training to testing suggests issues such as over-fitting and inherent noise in the dataset, along with the relatively low data volume using 250 trips only. However, acquiring first-hand data for EVs in the UAE is a key contribution of this work, which lays the ground for further studies into UAE-specific EV electricity demand modeling."

This study highlights the importance of fuel cells, specifically focusing on high-temperature and Nafion-free membranes. Membranes composed of zirconium phytate, silicotungstic acid, polyethylene glycol, and ionic liquids employing porous polytetrafluoroethylene polymer for support are reported. Investigating varying ratios of silicotungstic acid, polyethylene glycol, and ionic liquids, electrochemical spectroscopy revealed heightened proton conductivity upon ionic liquids integration. Initially, the unmodified zirconium phytate membrane demonstrated a conductivity of 6.65 × 10<sup>−4</sup> S/cm, escalating tenfold (2.23 × 10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm) with silicotungstic acid addition. Further enhancements, such as incorporating polyethylene glycol, led to an increase in the conductivity to 3.81 × 10<sup>−2</sup> S/cm. The maximum conductivity value obtained in this work (0.1 S/cm), comparable to Nafion, was achieved with 5.86 wt% of the 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide. Testing at elevated temperatures up to 150 °C revealed a drop in conductivity by two orders of magnitude (10<sup>−3</sup> S/cm), highlighting their remarkable conductive properties. Additionally, water uptake analysis demonstrated the membranes' ability to retain more than 60 wt% water molecules within their matrix. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis revealed the thermal stability of membranes at high temperatures up to 600 °C. These findings strongly indicate that these synthesized membranes possess considerable potential for high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications."

The derived model was implemented in an Eulerian-Eulerian Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework to simulate pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor operating at 550 °C. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of food waste composition, the reaction function and devolatilization kinetics were identified using a staged decomposition approach. As determined by TGA, these stages correspond to the decomposition of protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose approximately between 270 and 300 °C, and the decomposition of lipids approximately between 350 and 400 °C. The activation energy, obtained using three different model-free iso-conversional methods, was consistent, with an average value of Ea = 219.23 kJ/mol. The pyrolysis reaction was found to follow an order-based model, with the master plot method yielding an average reaction order of n = 10.3 and an Arrhenius frequency factor of A = 1.16 × 10<sup>19</sup> [(kmol/m<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1−n</sup>/s].

Consequently, researchers have developed reusing and recycling plans for end-of-life LIBs to extend their life spans, mitigate residual capacity loss, and reduce their environmental impact. As a result, many studies have recommended establishing a lifecycle framework for LIBs to identify and manage the potential options for reusing, recycling, remanufacturing, or disposal of second life LIBs. In response, the state of health (SOH) and state of safety (SOS) methods were introduced as key performance indicators (KPIs) to determine the batteries’ health and usability based on their capacity levels. Thus, both SOH and SOS methods are crucial for battery cell selection frameworks employed to designate batteries’ second-life applications. Various papers have analyzed and compared SOH methods, yet none have clearly quantified their differences, to determine the most effective method. Therefore, this study aims to create a framework for selecting the most effective SOH method for use in LIB frameworks by identifying and quantifying their main KPIs. The proposed framework will utilize scientometric analysis to identify the KPIs necessary for a gray relation analysis (GRA)-based multi-criteria decision matrix (MCDM) to select the appropriate SOH method."

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), rapid economic development has been accompanied by numerous initiatives aimed at addressing sustainability challenges, particularly in waste management. However, existing research often overlooks the socio-economic determinants of recycling behaviors in multicultural populations, particularly in the UAE. Most studies focus on homogeneous communities or broader municipal waste management strategies, leaving a gap in understanding how diverse socio-economic backgrounds influence recycling attitudes and practices. This study addresses this gap by examining the recycling behaviors of the diverse student population at the American University of Sharjah (AUS), which serves as a microcosm of society. To fill this research gap, the study employs survey-based data collection, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). CFA was chosen to validate the measurement model, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of key constructs. SEM was selected for its ability to examine complex relationships among latent variables, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how factors such as awareness, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, and perceived barriers influence recycling behaviors. The results reveal that intrinsic motivations, such as environmental awareness and responsibility, exert a stronger influence on recycling behaviors than external incentives like financial rewards. Specifically, SEM results indicate that high awareness levels significantly predict positive recycling attitudes and behaviors (p < 0.001), while barriers such as time constraints, complexity, and lack of infrastructure hinder participation. The findings have important practical implications, suggesting that tailored educational programs, enhanced recycling infrastructure, and targeted incentives can foster sustainable recycling behaviors. By leveraging the unique diversity of AUS students, the study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers and academic institutions."

Primary microplastic particles were procured in different sizes and colors for this study to ensure quality control. Experiments were conducted with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 g/L of ground granulated blast furnace slags were used in the study. All the experiments were conducted with 500 mg/L of microplastic concentrations. The experimental setups were operated on the shaker table and waited until they reached equilibrium. Standard analytical methods were used to test microplastic concentrations. Even though the experimental results indicated effective microplastic removal using ground granulated blast furnace slag, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer couldn’t identify and recognize the adsorption process with clarity. The experimental results indicated that an increase in the blast furnace slag decreased the microplastics concentrations. It was revealed that the increase in the microplastic size reduced the adsorptive capacity of the ground granulated blast furnace slag. The results also indicated that the freundlich isotherm model was better suited to represent the adsorption process than the Langmuir isotherm model.

The HDESs synthesized from dodecanoic acid with octanoic, nonanoic and decanoic acids were analyzed in terms of hydrophobicity, viscosity and stability. Further characterization employing FTIR to validate the stability of the aforementioned HDESs in aqueous conditions was performed. Within the series of synthesized HDESs, the SLM based on [Dod-Non] showed the highest degree of phenol removal, 81 % within 36 h, with greater permeability and flux. This high efficiency could be attributed to the [Dod-Non]-based SLM having the required balance of hydrophobicity and viscosity for enhanced phenol transfer from the aqueous phase. The main operational parameters, including feed pH, initial phenol concentration, stripping solution concentration, and flow rate, were studied systematically. The study revealed that a feed pH as low as 2.0, and moderate NaOH stripping concentrations (0.2 M) were optimum for phenol extraction. The stability test demonstrated no substantial variation in the performance of the HDES-based SLMs of solvent loss after multiple extraction and stripping cycles.

This study aims to assess the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) in the Northern Gabès Aquifer, Tunisia using two usual methods and different models supported by machine learning techniques. Hydrochemical parameters and geospatial analysis were conducted to assess the groundwater suitability for irrigation in the study area. Additionally, Machine Learning models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Resource Description Framework (RDF) were applied to predict IWQI. 42 groundwater samples were analyzed to calculate the IWQI. According to the first traditional method, the findings revealed that 35.714% were deemed unsuitable for irrigation. Whereas the second method shows that 92.857% of the samples were considered medium suitability for irrigation. Conversely, obtained results show that SVM performs exceptionally well for the two methods in terms of precision and consistency, achieving a high R2 values exceeding 0.99, and low RMSE and MAE. It demonstrates impressive predictive ability with strong performance. These differences in performance between these machine learning models bring great implications for making decisions in groundwater management in the study region.

This study presents the first health risk assessment of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks associated with exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 bound heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) based on air quality data collected during the years of 2016–2018 near Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport. The results reveal no significant carcinogenic risks for lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr). Additionally, AI-based regression analysis was applied to time-series dust monitoring data to enhance predictive capabilities in environmental monitoring systems. The estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) from PAH exposure exceeded the acceptable threshold (10<sup>−6</sup>) in several samples at both locations. The relationship between visibility and key environmental variables—PM1, PM2.5, PM10, total suspended particles (TSPs), wind speed, air pressure, and air temperature—was modeled using three machine learning algorithms: linear regression, support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Among these, SVM with an RBF kernel showed the highest accuracy in predicting visibility, effectively integrating meteorological data and particulate matter variables. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning models for environmental monitoring and the need for continued assessments of air quality and its health implications in the region."

Machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), has been employed to assess flood risks under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585) emission scenarios. The research utilized these models because they demonstrate high performance in handling difficult data relationships and both temporal patterns and sophisticated environmental data. SLR projections provided by computers generate forecasts that combine with digital elevation models (DEMs) to determine coastal flooding risks and locate flood-prone areas. Results reveal that Mumbai and Kolkata face the highest flood risks, particularly under high emission scenarios, while Kochi and Mangaluru exhibit moderate exposure. Model performance is validated using residual analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, confirming reliable predictive accuracy.

At the present, the large-scale production necessary for the commercialization of MOFs based industrial processes seems to be the greatest challenge, mainly due to the fact that MOFs require harsh operating conditions and large amounts of toxic solvents during their synthesis which result in added production costs and raise safety and environmental related concerns. This review provides an overview on the recent developments in the synthesis of MOFs and their green applications. The currently used solvothermal processes for the synthesis of MOFs necessitate the use of hazardous and non-renewable solvents such as such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylformamide (DEF), methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile. Green and economical routes for MOFs synthesis that are non-solvent based have been rigorously under study to facilitate the commercialization of synthesis processes that are safe and environmentally benign. Such processes include water-based MOF synthesis, mechanochemical MOFs synthesis and the use of super-critical fluids and ionic liquids as solvents to replace the conventionally used ones. The paper also discusses the recent developments in the applications of MOFs in innovative and vital applications such as hydrogen production, fuel cells, and water desalination.

Microwave assisted pyrolysis (MWAP) is an alternative heating approach to convert organic waste materials into value-added products, such as biochar (BC), biogas and bio-oil. Different types of biochar materials have been produced through microwave heating technique that, in most of the cases, can be utilized for adsorption of organic and inorganic pollutants. The BC have been employed as CO<inf>2</inf> mitigator and fertilizer for soils due to their promising physiochemical properties. In this review paper, we discuss the various aspects of Microwave assisted pyrolysis and the available case studies, as well as the mechanism of adsorption of different pollutants onto biochars. Development of microwaved biochar for other applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, electrode materials, and composite membranes are also discussed. It is believed that the development and synthesis of high potential biochar through microwave assisted pyrolysis still needs very precise adjustment of processing conditions, pre-treatment of feedstock and post treatment steps for further enhancement of properties for specific applications. The paper concludes that considering the sustainable route in development of high-performance biochar would make microwave assisted pyrolysis cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and tunable materials of great potential for wide range of applications."

Surface morphology examination revealed porous active-site structures. Modification of clay with sodium carbonate showed similar removal efficiency of 99% of MB to its raw counterpart. While all composite materials returned MB removals greater than 90%, their granular structures provided distinct application advantages over their powder forms. The adsorption kinetics was best described by pseudo-second-order kinetics with rate constants of 1.27x10<sup>-4</sup> and 1.15x10<sup>-2</sup> mg L<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> for clay alginate (CA) and raw clay material (RCM), respectively.

The human-to-human transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is now well estab-lished. The reported clinical observations and symptoms of this infection in humans appear in the range between being asymptomatic and severe pneumonia. The virus can be transmitted through aerosols and droplets that are released into the air by a carrier, especially when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks forcefully in a closed environment. As the disease progresses, the use and handling of contaminated personal protective equipment and facemasks have become major issues with significant environmental risks. Therefore, providing an effective method for treating used/contami-nated facemasks is crucial. In this paper, we review the environmental challenges and risks associated with the surge in facemask production. We also discuss facemasks and their materials as sources of microplastics and how disposal procedures can potentially lead to the contamination of water resources. We herein review the potential of developing nanomaterial-based antiviral and self-cleaning facemasks. This review discusses these challenges and concludes that the use of sustainable and alternative facemask materials is a promising and viable solution. In this context, it has become essential to address the emerging challenges by developing a new class of facemasks that are effective against the virus, while being biodegradable and sustainable. This paper represents the potentials of natural and/or biodegradable polymers for manufacturing facemasks, such as wood-based polymers, chitosan, and other biodegradable synthetic polymers for achieving sustainability goals during and after pandemics."

The increase in the interfacial area and the hydrodynamics induced by the viscous oil in the water column underneath the oil affect the dynamics of dissolution of oil in water. The mass transfer dynamics is investigated in the viscous-gravity spreading regime where gravity, promoting spreading, is resisted by the viscous force exerted by the water on the spreading oil. Both unidirectional and axisymmetric spreading cases are considered. A model is developed using an integral boundary layer approach based on fundamentals. The similarity solution provides the time dependent average mass transfer coefficient, concentration boundary layer thickness, and mass transfer coefficient profiles as functions of Schmidt number, geometry and time. Taking into account the typical large oil to water viscosity ratio, the results are discussed based on physical grounds in the light of boundary layer theory to interpret the difference in the asymptotic behavior of the solution near, and sufficiently far from the leading edge of the oil spill.

TGA and SEM confirmed comparative enhanced thermal stability and porous surface, respectively. Chemical reaction rate-altering parameters, i.e., pH, contact time, initial phenol concentration and temperature, are optimized at highest phenol removal. It was found that the maximum phenol adsorption capacity and highest removal efficiency by the adsorbent occurred at pH 2, initial phenol concentration of 150 mg/L, beads dosage of 6 mg/mL and contact time of 2 h with values of 16.28 mg/g and 65.12%, respectively. The pseudo-second order model fitted the adsorption kinetics well, and the Freundlich isotherm model gave the experimental data the best fit.

Therefore, it is essential that predictive tools are developed for estimating the physiochemical properties of ILs.

Biodiesel is produced from different feedstocks such as neem oil, palm oil, waste frying oil, vegetable oil, animal fat, microbial oil, etc. These feedstocks react with acidic, alkaline, enzymic, homogeneous, heterogeneous, and hybrid Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) catalysts, along with monohydric alcohol via transesterification reaction. The flexibility in its feedstock and the type of catalysts used, production cost, biodegradable and renewable nature makes it a promising alternative fuel than conventional diesel. The selection of apt feedstock and catalyst is the challenging task and governing factor of economic biodiesel production. Green solvents such as DES have high thermal stability and low volatility and can address the economic and green production issues significantly as compared to conventional alkali and acid catalysts. This review bridges the gap between the selection of feedstock and optimal catalyst for the respective feedstock. The exploration of DES fills the gap by attributing to 3Rs (i.e., recyclability, recovery, and reusability).

DES-3 had the highest extraction efficiency for alizarin among the other synthesized DESs. The effect of process variables such pH, contact time, dye initial concentration, volume ratio, temperature and salt on alizarin extraction efficiency from water stream was explored, optimized and reported. Statistical analysis was conducted to ensure the accuracy of values for the optimized parameters. For a 1000 mg/L solution of alizarin with a DES/alizarin volume ratio of 1:10 at room temperature, the maximum elimination of 98.02 percent was achieved in 5 min. FTIR was used to analyze the structural properties of DES and the interaction between DES and alizarin. The thermal stability of DES-3 was determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and indicated that DES-3 has excellent thermal stability up to 320<sup>◦</sup>C. Human saline was used to test the toxicity of the synthesized DES in vitro. It was determined that synthesized DES is less harmful and more effective at removing alizarin."

With an increasing number of large structures and modern, complex design, the need for high-performance SHM systems is unprecedented. Structural performance assessment, damage detection, and continuous monitoring are among the current SHM applications. However, all SHM applications face challenges and limitations in several aspects. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of such challenges and limitations, and sheds light on some future research needs and directions. The most widely used frameworks and their respective limitations are presented and discussed with a focus on real-life applications pertaining to large structures. Driven by many recent technological advancements, SHM systems are shifting away from conventional, contact-based sensors in favor of more efficient, non-contact-based sensors. This is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but rather a stepping-stone and pathway to a solid understanding of the SHM field and its current intricacies pertaining to large structures. Naturally, some of the highlighted issues can be extended to all types of structures."

    "title": "A comprehensive multi-level circular economy assessment framework — Basil M. Darras",
    "abstract": "With several industries shifting from the conventional liner to circular economy (CE) models, it became necessary to develop standard tools to assess the circularity of different products and processes to facilitate this transition. The conducted thorough literature review presented in this paper concludes that most circularity assessment tools lack comprehensiveness and objectivity due to complexities that arise from the quantification processes of qualitative data, the extensive use of linguistic terms, and the difficulty in combining more than one indicator in case of similarity, dependency, or both. Thus, this paper aims to develop a comprehensive CE assessment framework that is capable of assessing the circularity of processes and products from a wide range of industries and sectors. The framework developed enables a comprehensive assessment by incorporating a step-by-step indicators selection procedure that covers the micro, meso, and macro CE levels of implementation. Also, the framework is capable of dealing with quantitative as well as qualitative indicators while limiting uncertainties associated with linguistic terms. This is achieved by incorporating fuzzy logic into the assessment framework. Moreover, it offers flexibility in selecting between subjective and objective assessment methods through the integration of several Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods that are also used to rank the assessed processes or products based on their circularity. An example was presented to validate the applicability of the framework and to guide users on to how to draw conclusions about the circularity of the assessed objects from the scores obtained. In the example, the circularity of Friction Stir Back Extrusion (FSBE) is assessed against the circularity of conventional extrusion. FSBE achieved a relative circularity score of 69.23% compared to 30.77% for conventional extrusion. In future, it is encouraged that policymakers and experts collect and build databases of indicators of their own fields to ease the circularity assessment and enhance its consistency."

As a result of inefficient removal of these micropollutants from wastewater, they have been detected in potable water supplies. In this work, photocatalysts were prepared by incorporating TiO<inf>2</inf> and ZnO into the framework of the MOF, MIL-53(Al), and were used in photodegradation studies of single and binary mixtures of naproxen, ibuprofen and methyl orange. The photocatalyst composites, MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> and MIL-53(Al)@ZnO, were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET and FE-SEM, which confirmed attachment of TiO<inf>2</inf> and ZnO nanoparticles to MIL-53(Al). DRS revealed direct optical band gaps of MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> and MIL-53(Al)@ZnO to be 3.34 eV and 3.24 eV, respectively. Uncoated MIL-53(Al) showed greatest photodegradation efficiency for naproxen (89.5%), closely followed by MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> (80.3%) and MIL-53(Al)@ZnO (76.6%). Uncoated MIL-53(Al) was also efficient at degrading ibuprofen from single and binary micropollutant systems, with MIL-53(Al)@ZnO performing better than MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> in both systems. MIL-53(Al)@ZnO was the only photocatalyst that was able to degrade methyl orange in both systems. It was established that a 3:1 ratio of naproxen (mg/L) to MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf>(mg) was optimum for photodegradation, while for ibuprofen and methyl orange in single and binary systems, a 2:1 ratio of total micropollutant (mg/L) to MIL-53(Al)@ZnO (mg) gave the best degradation performance. The photodegradations kinetics were investigated and fitted to zero and pseudo-first/second order models. Recyclability of MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> for three consecutive photodegradation cycles showed a decrease of only 13.6% in photodegradation efficiency. Experiments conducted with scavengers showed that hydroxyl radicals played a major role in the photocatalytic process photodegradation, and it was found that only 1 h of treatment was sufficient to obtain a considerable COD reduction of 58%. This study provides a promising strategy for uniform MOF loading into ZnO and TiO<inf>2</inf> for binary pharmaceutical and dye wastewater photodegradation treatment."

    "abstract": "As the population continues to rise, the demand for resources and environmentally friendly management of produced wastes has shown a significant increase in concern. To decrease the impact of these wastes on the environment, it is important to utilize the wastes in producing and/or recovering usable products to provide for the sustainable management of resources. One nonrenewable and rapidly diminishing resource is phosphorus, which is used in several products, the most important being its use in manufacturing chemical fertilizer. With the increase in demand but reduction in availability of naturally occurring mineral phosphorus, it is important to investigate other sources of phosphorus. Phosphorus is most commonly recovered through struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) precipitation. The recovery of phosphorus from various wastewater has been well established and documented with recovery rates mostly above 90%. However, one of the major drawbacks of the recovery is the high cost of chemicals needed to precipitate the phosphorus. Since the external magnesium needed to achieve struvite precipitation accounts for around 75% of the total chemical cost, applicability of low-cost magnesium sources, such as bittern or seawater, can help reduce the operational cost significantly. This paper investigates the different magnesium sources that have been used for the recovery of phosphorus, highlighting the different approaches and operating conditions investigated, and their corresponding phosphorus recovery rates. An investigation of the economic aspects of the magnesium sources used for removal/recovery show that costs are dependent on the raw waste treated, the source of magnesium and the location of treatment. A review of published articles on the economics of phosphorus removal/recovery also indicates that there is a lack of studies on the economics of the treatment processes, and there is a need for a comprehensive study on life cycle assessment of such processes that go beyond the technical and economical aspects of treatment processes."

    "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the most energy-intensive industries. Every stage of wastewater treatment consumes energy, which is the primary contributor to WWTP costs. Adsorbents and process optimization are critical for energy savings. The removal of dyes from industrial wastewater by adsorption using commercially available adsorbents is inefficient. Metal– organic frameworks (MOFs) have outstanding properties that can improve separation performance over current commercial adsorbents, and thus, these materials represent a milestone in improving dye removal in water treatment methods. In this work, three types of metal–organic frameworks (Fe-BTC, Cu-BTC, and ZIF-8) have been investigated as prospective adsorbents for methyl orange removal from water in batch setups. The results showed that at 15 mg/L MO initial concentration and 100 mg dosage, Fe-BTC had the highest removal efficiency of 91%, followed by ZIF-8 (63%), and finally Cu-BTC (35%), which exhibited structural damage due to its instability in water. Fe-BTC maintained consistent adsorption capacity over a wide range of pH values. Furthermore, a 2<sup>3</sup> full factorial design analysis was implemented to evaluate the conditions for maximum MO-removal efficiency. The main effects, interaction effects, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the Pareto chart were reported. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the MOF type was the most significant factor, followed by dosage and initial concentration. The analysis indicated that the type of MOF and dosage had a positive effect on the removal efficiency, while the initial concentration had a negative effect. The two-way and three-way interactions were also found to be significant."

    "abstract": "One major source of environmental pollution is industrial effluents, especially the heavy metal pollutants, including zinc, in the wastewater discharged from manufacturing industries (hereinafter known as an environmental process). The safe disposal of such effluents into aquatic environments is very crucial and of great health and environmental concerns worldwide. To safeguard the quality of the receiving waters, continuous and effective monitoring of zinc in industrial effluents before discharging it into the environment is essential. However, the real-life environmental data are often skewed and do not follow the normal distribution. Therefore, classical statistical process monitoring techniques based on normality assumptions cannot be used directly to monitor the environmental processes. To overcome this limitation, this study designs an optimal X‾ scheme for monitoring non-normal zinc data in industrial effluents. This scheme minimizes the total cost, including quality and manpower costs, based on optimal deployment of manpower. The optimization process ensures that the false alarm rate of the monitoring scheme meets the allowable value. A fractional factorial experiment considering different design specifications shows that the proposed optimal X‾ scheme reduces the associated costs by about 69% and 36% compared to the basic X‾ and improved X‾ schemes, respectively. The robustness of the performance of the optimal X‾ scheme is further investigated under different non-normal, and process shift distributions. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to explore the impact of the input parameters on the associated cost of the optimal X‾ scheme. Lastly, the design and application of the proposed optimal X‾ scheme are presented using real data on zinc content in the wastewater emitted from a steel production plant."

Providing an efficient method for the removal of oil from produced water is a challenging task. In this study, the effects of carbon chain length and the cation nature of ionic liquids (ILs) on the removal efficiency of oil from produced water were investigated. For this purpose, seven ILs containing the bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (NTf<inf>2</inf>) anion, and various cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, phosphonium, and ammonium, were employed for the removal of oil from produced water via liquid–liquid extraction.

The presented study can incorporate both physics-of-failure models and sensory data to update the failure probabilities of the components in the offshore salt cavern storage system. The fault tree considers unintentional flow as the main failure mode and divides the system into three subsystems: the wellhead, the well and the cavern itself. Then, each individual subsystem is studied based on the components in the subsystem and the NORSOK standards for safe well design. The fault tree presented in this study also outlines the relationship between the failure modes and the effect they have on the system failure.

This paper presents a comprehensive experimental assessment of post-consumption food waste characteristics, its conversion to added-value products through pyrolysis, and its potentials for worldwide large-scale processing. Analysis of the food waste samples revealed highly desirable features (e.g., volatile = 75.2%, lipid = 15.4%, and HHV = 20.1 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>). The overall pyrolysis yield was 37.2% bio-oil, 14.2% aqueous phase, 27.6% biochar, and 21.0% non-condensable gas. The bio-oil showed attractive fuel characteristics (HHV = 28.2 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>, water content = 4.6%, and pH = 6), however, the viscosity was high (136 cSt). The most abundant compounds in the bio-oil were major fatty acids commonly found in dairy fats, meat, and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The biochar has an improved characteristic (HHV = 26.3 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup> and O/C = 0.065), which makes it potentially useful for energy applications as well as for long-term carbon sequestration if used in soil amendment. The non-condensable gas has an energy content of 15.8 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>, nearly 30% that of natural gas. In assessing the worldwide potential implementation of food waste pyrolysis, the calculations indicate that Eastern and Southern Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, respectively, are of the highest potential for large-scale processing. The estimated world's energy output is 1376.2 GW and this is predicted to contribute to around 30% to the world's demand of renewable energies by 2026, if this feedstock is fully utilized. Most importantly, the outcome of this study is highly encouraging for the development of bioenergy technology in regions where conventional biomass resources are limited, such as arid and semi-arid regions."

The photocatalytic activity of MIL-53(Al)@TiO<inf>2</inf> remained unchanged (>90%), while for MIL-53(Al) and MIL-53(Al)@ZnO a slight drop was observed over three cyclic degradation experiments. Fluorescence measurements revealed that the hydroxyl radical is an important reactive oxygen species produced by all the photocatalysts that aid in the photodegradation of DCF. Furthermore, the kinetic modelling of the photoreaction identified a second-order kinetics for all catalysts. Experiments with scavengers showed that hydroxyl radicals played a major role in the photocatalytic process, and it was found that only 2 h of treatment was sufficient to obtain a considerable chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of 58%."

Combined with soil erosion rates estimated by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation for the past 20 years, we examined the contributions of different factors to TSS trends. The results show that TSS concentrations in the Yangtze River decreased from 0.47 g L<sup>−1</sup> in 2000 to 0.23 g L<sup>−1</sup> in 2018 due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), especially in the Jingjiang reach, with a declining magnitude of 0.3 g L<sup>−1</sup> (∼56%) since the TGD began operating. The Mekong River experienced increasing TSS concentration trends upstream and decreasing trends downstream from 2000 to 2018, possibly attributed to increased upstream soil erosion and decreased downstream water discharge. Declining TSS concentrations in both rivers have driven varying degrees of river channel erosion over the past two decades. This study investigated long-term changes in the TSS concentrations and soil erosion in the Yangtze and Mekong rivers, and the results provide baseline information for the sustainable development of river sediment delivery."

In addition, Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate models were constructed from FE simulation results to estimate the properties of salt caverns with cheaper calculations. Then, to obtain a reliable and robust design, an RBDO framework was employed with the assistance of an adaptive fidelity enhancement technique to scan through the high-dimensional design space, which provides a swift and efficient search for the optimal conditions while considering the uncertainties in the salt cavern construction process. This research is one of the first to account for uncertainties within the salt cavern design process, and the results show that uncertainties of variables can strongly affect the system reliability and the volume of the salt cavern."

    "abstract": "Transitioning to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) is thought to substantially curb emissions, promoting sustainable development. However, the extent of the problem extends beyond tailpipe emissions. To facilitate decision-making and planning of future infrastructural developments, the economic, social, and technological factors of ZEVs should also be addressed. Therefore, this work implements the circular economy paradigm to identify the most suitable vehicle type that can accelerate sustainable development by calculating circularity scores for Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) and two ZEVs, the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs). The circularity assessment presents a novel assessment procedure that interrelates the environmental, economic, social, and technological implications of each vehicle type on the three implementation levels of the circular economy (i.e., The macro, meso, and micro levels). The results of our analysis suggest that not all ZEVs are considered sustainable alternatives to ICEVs. BEVs scored the highest relative circularity score of 36.8% followed by ICEVs and FCEVs scoring 32.9% and 30.3% respectively. The results obtained in this study signify the importance of conducting circular economy performance assessments as planning tools as this assessment methodology interrelate environmental, social, economic, and technological factors which are integral for future infrastructural and urban planning."

    "abstract": "The presence of various micropollutants in different water sources has become a major problem due to their significant impact on both humans and the environment. This review highlights the different types of micropollutants present at the global scale and the methods applied to reduce and possibly eliminate them. These methods include membranes, adsorption and photocatalysis. While membrane filtration is extremely effective, one membrane can eliminate only a few micropollutants and its deployment remains expensive. On the other hand, adsorption constitutes a very efficient and cost-effective method, but the production of adsorbents is extremely energy intensive. Lastly, the photocatalysis method is considered to be the most promising as it avoids the problems associated with the aforementioned methods. Specifically, photocatalysts make use of direct sunlight in order to degrade micropollutants. Several types of photocatalysts, including biochar, Mxenes, nanoscaled zero valent iron, and MOFs, are discussed. Unlike the first four aforementioned types, MOFs can be combined with different materials to enhance the overall property of the composite and its efficiency in the degradation of micropollutants. The MOF-catalysts discussed in this paper include biomimetic MOFs, enzyme MOFs, and Fenton-like MOFs. The obtained system is referred to as MOF-composite-based catalysts. MOFs can be synthesized by combining an appropriate organic linker with a metallic cluster that would provide the material with the required properties for photodegradation. Several metal–organic framework catalyst composites synthesis approaches are reviewed and discussed. The selection of the approach depends on the requirements associated with the application of interest. To date, extensive research has been conducted on the performance analysis of metal–organic framework composites to investigate their efficiency in the removal of micropollutants. Several studies demonstrated their great removal capability which may reach up to 99 %. Finally, cost, health and environmental considerations are discussed with the view of the industrial applicability of MOF-composite-based catalysts. This comprehensive review presents the current state of the art and proposed promising research directions for the implementation and advancement of MOF-composite-based catalysts for micropollutants degradation."

This work aims to investigate some of the environmental implications of SAEVs compared to privately owned electric vehicles (EVs) through a set of assessment criteria consisting of their life cycle global warming potential (GWP), water footprint and energy demand. In addition, this work examines how different circular economy (CE) practices and energy mixes influence the SAEV's environmental implications. The analysis conducted shows that SAEVs have higher negative environmental effects than private conventional EVs. However, circularity practices were found to decrease these effects. CE practices reduced the GWP, water footprint, and energy demands of SAEVs by 21.4 %, 18.2 %, and 17.3 % respectively. Results have also shown that utilizing the projected 2050 U.S. energy mix and incorporating CE practices throughout the life cycle of an SAEV will decrease the GWP, water footprint, and energy demand by 46 %, 36.2 %, and 39.3 % respectively. In contrast, by utilizing an energy mix that only consists of the clean energy sources of the 2050 U.S. energy mix in the same proportions but forming 100 % of the mix, the GWP, water footprint and energy demand decrease by 73.2 %, 51.2 %, and 29.1 % respectively. The analysis shows that an SAEV will always have higher GWP, water footprint, and energy demand compared to an EV utilizing the same battery due to deadheading and the increased power consumption caused by the additional automation enabling components."

This study aims to develop a new meteorological drought index based on fuzzy logic (FL) and neuro-fuzzy models to describe and predict droughts. The developed models were compared to nine conventional drought indices and correlated with multiple drought indicators. Different combinations of inputs (such as maximum temperature, mean temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration) were tested to develop the models. Observed weather data from Alice Springs, Australia, were used to examine the developed models and train the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. Additionally, historical records of various drought indicators were used to evaluate the predictions of all models, including deep soil moisture, lower soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, upper soil moisture, and runoff. This study showed that the rainfall anomaly drought index (RAI) was the best conventional drought index, with the highest correlation (0.718) between the drought index and upper soil moisture (drought indicator). The average of the best-performing FL models outperformed all conventional indices, with a correlation of 0.784 with the upper soil moisture. Moreover, when the average output of the best-performing FL models was used for training, the best ANFIS model had a correlation of 0.809 with upper soil moisture. The best ANFIS model in terms of correlation with conventional drought indices had a correlation of 0.941 with the RAI when the normalised average output of the best-performing conventional drought indices was used for training. To validate the developed models, drought assessment was conducted for five stations in different climate zones and seasons. The validation results showed that the developed models had similar performance to the best-correlated conventional drought index (RAI) in most cases. The developed models yielded better predictions compared to the conventional index in the subtropical and tropical regions. Overall, the developed soft computing drought indices based on fuzzy logic and ANFIS outperformed conventional methods, thus effectively contributing to more precise drought prediction and mitigation."

The current amine-based technologies (ABTs) for CO<inf>2</inf> capture (CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf>) have high energy demand, low absorption, and desorption rates, and are less environmentally sustainable due to high emissions of volatile solvents. Therefore, the development of environmentally friendly CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> materials and/or processes is a growing area of research. The utilization of ionic liquids (ILs) for CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> has recently attracted attention. The unique characteristics of ILs, such as their low vapor pressure and high affinity for CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> as well as their low volatility make them a viable substitute for the existing processes. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the accomplishments and challenges during the use of ILs for CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf>. The Review also outlines the mechanisms of the CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> with ILs at the molecular level, the properties of ILs, characterization of the CO<inf>2</inf>/IL systems, and the effect of operating conditions on CO<inf>2</inf> uptake (UP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf>) capacity by ILs. It also emphasizes the impact of cations, anions, and functional groups on the solubility of CO<inf>2</inf> ((S<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf>)) in ILs as well as the biodegradability and toxicity of ILs. Additionally, recent advances in IL membrane technology for the CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> processes are considered. Lastly, the contribution of molecular simulations to create and assess ILs was reviewed. Protic and aprotic ILs properties have shown outstanding efficiency of UP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf>. The interactions between the anionic part of IL and CO<inf>2</inf> enhance the UP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> and outperform the efficiency of traditional organic solvents. Functionalized ionic liquids (FUN<inf>ILs</inf>) with tuned functional groups, supported ionic liquids membranes (SILMs) as well as reversible ionic liquids (RILs) have improved the efficiency of ILs as a promising CO<inf>2</inf> capturing process from industrial streams even under low CO<inf>2</inf> partial pressure. The relative importance of the chemical breakdown of the IL constituents (cation–anion interfacial structuring) during the CAP<inf>CO<inf>2</inf></inf> process at different operating temperatures is unclear, and more research in this area is required to better inform the design of new ILs.

    "abstract": "In an age where oil and gas industries are booming and identified as key sectors in the economy, production quantities drastically increased worldwide. This highlighted the importance of monitoring and improving the reliability of these systems as they can have a high impact on the health and safety of the surrounding environment. Many studies have been invested in long-Term monitoring of production wells both onshore and off-shore, however, there are still significant gaps when addressing the monitoring of off-shore, partially observed systems. While the risks and effects of failures in such systems have been studied and outlined, there is still more work to be done on combining heterogenous data sources to improve the understanding of partially observed systems. In order to utilize all available data for system observability and analyses, the complex relationships between the data sources needs to be quantified and leveraged to predict the impact on the system reliability or state. This work aims to utilize machine learning tools to combine available data and information to understand the state of the reliability of offshore production wells as well as isolate possible root causes of failures given partial information.Research on multi-fidelity methods is readily available to identify relationships between different information sources. However, combining multi-fidelity tools with system risk and reliability monitoring tools is a large area of research that is missing. The current work provides a nexus between a Bayesian Optimization (BO) based multi-fidelity tool for system state identification and a Dynamic Bayesian Network for continuous monitoring of the health of the system and the potential impact from subsystems. Dynamic Bayesian Networks are used to model the time-dependent nature of the state of complex systems by identifying paths of component failures and the relationship between the subcomponents. This work builds upon a Gaussian-Process based multi-fidelity BO method, MFNets, that can provide a probabilistic surrogate modeling method to integrate available data sources to be used to make better predictions on the states of the effected components or subsystems. The results show that the value of leveraging this information is invaluable to understanding complex systems with very limited data. A case study of an off-shore production well is used to illustrate the significant benefit of incorporating all available information of different fidelity levels to update the beliefs of the system."

Factors leading to the exposure of the natural environment to these risks are mainly anthropogenic with the most significant factor being the high dependence on fossil fuels which increase the concentration of two major greenhouse gases (GHGs), i.e., CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf>. Consequently, the world is faced with not just a rapid rise in global temperatures, but on a wider spectrum, the bizarre behaviour of different ecosystems of the world with the quality of air not left out.

This study highlights how the air quality has impacted on the climate changes using Nigeria as a case study. Climatic changes such as prolonged dry and sunny season results in wildfires which obviously degrade the quality of air by reducing the oxygen content and introducing smoke and particulate. The population explosion and hence, the need for more fossil fuels and limited oxygen in the metropolitan cities of Nigeria such as Lagos is the major reason for the poor air quality index (AQI) relative to other suburban and rural areas. The continuous rise in global warming is characterized by increments in the presence of toxic components like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) levels in the atmosphere.

A total of 480 MPs pieces extracted from the samples were analyzed in order to detect heavy metals. The polymer composition was previously confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, showing that polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were the most abundant MPs. 14 heavy metals were identified in the samples: Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pd, and Co with different concentrations. Five of them (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) are priority pollutants according to EPA. Their average concentrations in oxide form were Cr<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (2.96 %), NiO (0.32 %), CuO (0.45 %), ZnO (0.56 %), and PbO (1.49 %)."

    "title": "A Review on Membrane Fouling Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) — Naif Darwish, Ghaleb Husseini",
    "abstract": "Membrane fouling is a major hurdle to effective pressure-driven membrane processes, such as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO). Fouling refers to the accumulation of particles, organic and inorganic matter, and microbial cells on the membrane’s external and internal surface, which reduces the permeate flux and increases the needed transmembrane pressure. Various factors affect membrane fouling, including feed water quality, membrane characteristics, operating conditions, and cleaning protocols. Several models have been developed to predict membrane fouling in pressure-driven processes. These models can be divided into traditional empirical, mechanistic, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful tools for nonlinear mapping and prediction, and they can capture complex relationships between input and output variables. In membrane fouling prediction, ANNs can be trained using historical data to predict the fouling rate or other fouling-related parameters based on the process parameters. This review addresses the pertinent literature about using ANNs for membrane fouling prediction. Specifically, complementing other existing reviews that focus on mathematical models or broad AI-based simulations, the present review focuses on the use of AI-based fouling prediction models, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their derivatives, to provide deeper insights into the strengths, weaknesses, potential, and areas of improvement associated with such models for membrane fouling prediction."

This work aims to evaluate the economics of upfront nitrogen removal (UNrem) that should save energy, improve efficiency, increase production, and boost economic feasibility. This novel idea of UNrem was investigated through a detailed economic analysis of several UNrem cases. Results showed that the total power requirement and the production rate could be decreased upon the implementation of the UNrem concept. Compared with baseline operation, removing up to 87.5% of nitrogen from the feed was found optimal as it decreases the total power requirement by 0.24 MW and increases the LNG product flow rate by 4.4 %, while exergy loss decreased by 7.08 MW. The UNrem of 87.5% scenarios showed a profit of 24.2 billion USD in 20 years. Results confirmed the importance of the UNrem process for energy savings, process improvement, and profit without the need for structural changes."

    "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion have been known to cause detrimental health and environmental effects. The currently used hydrodesulfurization (HDS) method employed by refineries has several drawbacks, such as excessive hydrogen consumption, high energy demand, and inability to remove complex organosulfur compounds, which have limited its ability to produce ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) at reasonable operating and capital costs. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely studied for their potential to replace conventional HDS. However, while their success has been demonstrated at the laboratory level, studies on industrial-scale feasibility and their integration into process simulators such as Aspen Plus are limited. In this work, 26 commercially available ILs have been screened using COSMO-based models and Aspen Plus for the desulfurization of diesel fuel and several possible process configurations have been examined. In particular, the challenge of ionic liquid regeneration, which has largely been ignored in the literature, has also been addressed and several potential regeneration methods have been proposed including extractive regeneration (E-RE) and stripping regeneration using nitrogen and air as stripping media (S-RE). The results indicate that, among the 26 ILs studied, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate is the most promising as a solvent for extractive desulfurization (EDS), E-RE, and S-RE. E-RE was found to be more effective for the removal of dibenzothiophene (DBT), while S-RE is more suited to the removal of thiophene and benzothiophene (BT). As a result, an optimized diesel desulfurization process using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate has been proposed that achieves ULSD with <10 ppm total sulfur in simulation studies, with complete recycling of the IL and minimal loss of the model diesel."

    "abstract": "Mangroves are imperative to coastal systems, providing security against extreme weather events by acting as natural barriers. These halophytic plants play a crucial role in mitigating global warming and act as an invaluable resource for consumption. Despite being resilient, mangroves exhibit sensitivity to climatic (e.g., land surface temperature, salinity, etc.) and artificial factors (e.g., land use land cover changes). Numerous past studies recorded the relationship between mangrove growth & development with the constituents above, but those were mostly restricted to visual observation/pattern recognition and single regression analysis. Also, evaluating the simultaneous exploration of multiple aspects influencing mangrove evolution was not prominent. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to focus on the impact of both salinity and land surface temperature on mangrove biomass by the joint venture of remote sensing, geographic information system and several machine learning algorithms. The study considered appropriate mangrove site selections by preprocessing the acquired satellite images. Also, mathematical computations were performed on the raster layers to determine the previously mentioned natural aspects. Finally, several types of regression analysis were conducted to delineate potential patterns governing mangrove vegetation health under temperature and salinity. Mangroves’ relationship with temperature and salinity showed an insignificant coefficient of determination. However, the generated response curves postulated that high mangrove biomass could be achieved for a specific temperature window (30−33 °C), and vegetation health could deteriorate at increasing salinity. Overall, the combined effects of surface temperature and salinity on mangrove vegetation were significantly more (i.e., maximum coefficient of determination of 0.31) than individual components alone."

The latter is a green and facile alternative for synthesis with its solvent-free, room-temperature operation. In addition, ball milling produces ZIF-8 samples with superior CO2 adsorption and detection characteristics, as concluded from fluorescence measurements. Characterization tests including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) are conducted to inspect the structural morphology, the thermal stability, and elements content of the ZIF-8 samples obtained from the different aforementioned synthesis techniques. The characterization tests revealed the appearance of a new phase of ZIF-8 which is ZIF-L when deploying the ball milling technique with different structure, morphology, response to CO<inf>2</inf> exposure and thermal stability when compared to its counterparts. Fluorescence measurements are carried out to evaluate the limit of detection (LOD), selectivity, and recyclability of the different ZIF-8 samples. The LOD of the ZIF-8 sample synthesized based on ball milling synthesis technique is 815.2 ppm, while LODs of the samples obtained from microwave and room temperature-based synthesis techniques are 1780.6 ppm and 723.8 ppm, respectively. This indicates that the room temperature and ball milling produced MOFs have comparable LODs. However, the room temperature procedure requires the use of a harmful solvent.

The direct objective of our work is to calculate the equilibrium concentration of the Cl<sup>−</sup> co-ion inside a swelled cation-exchange membrane equilibrated with a water/NaCl system. Two activity coefficient models are employed, i.e., the Debye–Huckel (DH) model (as a reference model) and the Meissner model, which is known for its applicability in treating concentrated solutions. Experimental data available in the literature for Donnan potential are used to verify model predictions. Our study confirms that a high fixed charge density is required to counterbalance the deterioration in membrane selectivity encountered in high-salinity systems. The DH model can be safely used to predict the Donnan potential for feed compositions up to 0.1 M. At higher compositions, the DH model significantly overestimates the predicted (absolute) Donnan potential compared to the Meissner model. The osmotic pressure resulting from the difference in ionic concentration between the membrane phase and the feed phase is found to have insignificant effects on the Donnan potential. The equilibrium computations and methodology are presented in a general way that enables handling multivalent electrolyte systems such as CaCl<inf>2</inf>."

Thirteen input parameters, including operational parameters, water characteristic parameters, and time-dependent parameters, were used to predict salt rejection. The results suggested that ensemble techniques are more capable of predicting the performance of RO membranes. Among ensemble methods, the XGBoost model was found to outperform other models. Recursive feature elimination was integrated with Shapley additive explanation analysis to gain insights into the most influential predictors and confirm the model's ability to comprehend the RO membrane mechanism. The findings highlighted that five parameters are critical for predicting RO membrane performance and could be prioritized for future monitoring to provide timely membrane performance warnings: the membrane's age, feed water temperature, pressure, feed water flow, and chloride concentration. It also indicated that maintaining lower temperatures, increasing feed water pressure, and increasing feed flow can improve process efficiency.

The impact of tar (bio-oil) thermal cracking on the pyrolysis yield was investigated using a model derived from lignocellulose biomass. At a pyrolysis temperature of 525 °C, the devolatilization efficiency was 70.1%, and the predicted product composition was 41.2% bio-oil, 37.6% char, and 21.2% non-condensable gases, which closely matched the experimental findings. The mean gas residence time over the temperature range investigated was 0.38–0.45 s, falling within the recommended range for fast pyrolysis. Increasing the temperature beyond approximately 500 °C decreased bio-oil yield, primarily due to the thermal cracking of tar. Remarks on the modeling approach and implementation for large-scale simulation are discussed."

For many of the components of these toxic insecticides, patents have been expired; however, farmers and consumers who continue to use these chemicals are unaware of the products’ toxicity and the environmental effects they have. Thus, agricultural industries are required to consider diverse methods to minimize neonicotinoid use in farming operations and move away from the current prevailing methods. In this short review, the negative effects of neonicotinoid use; the toxic components, health effects, and environmental regulations of neonicotinoids; and sustainable methods to minimize their use are examined."

The preparation of beads was effectively carried out through the polymer coating process utilizing sodium alginate. To study the effect of different factors on adsorption capacity and removal %age of Malachite Green in a batch process, we employed a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design study analysis. The investigation involved three primary factors, each with two levels: MOF type (A: Fe-BTC and ZIF-8), MOF bead dosage (B: 50 mg to 100 mg), and initial concentration (C: 5 mg/L to 17 mg/L). The primary effects of these variables and their interactions were examined using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), main effect, interaction effect, and Pareto chart. The factorial design analysis, conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA), revealed that the most significant factor influencing adsorption capacity was the initial concentration of MG, followed by the dosage of MOF beads and the type of MOFs. The study demonstrates that SA@ZIF-8 beads have achieved the highest removal rate of 96%, in comparison to SA@Fe-BTC which reaches 90%. Notably, the initial concentration of MG demonstrates a positive effect, MOF dosage exhibits a negative effect, while the MOF type presents a positive effect, favoring SA@ZIF-8 for higher adsorption capacity. Moreover, significant two-way and three-way interactions were identified. The optimum conditions for the maximum removal of MG dye using SA@ZIF-8 were reported as follows: adsorbent dosage = 50 mg; MG initial concentration = 17 mg/L. The R2 value > 98.8% for MG dye underscores the potency of the factorial design model, thereby encouraging further exploration and application of SA@ZIF8 metal-organic framework to eliminate pollutants from aqueous solutions."

Despite the growing concern over microplastic pollution, there have been limited studies assessing its contamination in groundwater. This may be attributed to the lack of monitoring efforts specifically focused on microplastics in groundwater. In the UAE, groundwater accounts for more than half of the water supply. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the presence of microplastics in groundwater in the UAE. The study identified 30 groundwater boreholes in the Rahmaniya, Bedee, and Falah regions of Sharjah, UAE, from which samples were collected. To prepare the samples, a series of pretreatment procedures involving 30% hydrogen peroxide, density separation, and extraction filters were employed. Microplastics were subsequently detected using a microscope with 40x magnification, revealing the presence of microplastics in the water of 11 boreholes in Rahmaniya, ranging from 12 to 235 n/L, respectively. In the Falah area, contamination was observed in two boreholes, with 56 and 41 n/L, respectively, while no contamination was found in the Bedee area. Characterization of microplastics was conducted using ATRFTIR analysis, which has successfully matched the obtained spectra with polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, and polypropylene for 10 samples. GIS analysis, using IDW interpolation, highlighted significant microplastics contamination in Rahmaniya. The study also identified potential sources of contamination, including industrial areas, the Sajaa landfill, Bedee Farmland, and the water dump lagoon."

However, the behavior and impact of these contaminants in urban runoff and floodwaters resulting from natural disasters remain a significant research gap. A recent extreme weather event across Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), raises questions about the fate, transport, and potential impacts of CECs in an otherwise arid region where they have been rarely monitored. Causing flooding and loss of life in Oman and UAE, this extreme weather event also led to sewage treatment plant failures, accumulation of urban runoff likely to contain chemical pollutants, and the potential for cross-contamination of treated water traversing distribution systems via cracked pipes. In this Viewpoint, we explore some of the potential impacts of urban runoff from unexpected storms and heavy rainfall in arid countries, which are increasingly common in our rapidly changing climate. We discuss the potential pathways of pollutants during these events and identify the hidden risks associated with CECs, which are unregulated and not typically monitored in water used for domestic or agricultural purposes. While highlighting the dangers of CECs, such as residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), tire-derived products, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and microplastics, we also include commonly regulated contaminants such as heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) resulting from industrial activities."

Laboratory experiments were conducted in PVC pipes to simulate MP leaching at varying pH, chlorine doses, and stagnation times. Water samples from the experiments were tested for different water quality parameters, including MPs using standard procedures. The total organic carbon concentration in the water samples increased with stagnation period indicating that organic substances including MPs were leaching from the pipes. The concentration of leached particles as well as the MPs count increased with stagnation period. A strong correlation was found between the MPs count and the mass concentration of leached particles retained on the filter papers leading to the conclusion that most of the leached particles were MPs. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed peaks associated with C–Cl and C–H bonds that are typical for PVC suggesting that particles retained in the filter are likely PVC microplastics.

However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits."

    "abstract": "Plastics are predominant in numerous sectors like packaging, agriculture, hardware, electronics, and many others. Annual plastic demand has been rapidly growing in the last few decades because of the increasing dependency on plastics. As a consequence, massive amounts of plastic waste are being generated every year. These plastic wastes are non-biodegradable, and hence their disposal poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and causes significant environmental problems such as endangering the safety of marine life, wildlife, air, water, and soil, etc. A large portion of plastic waste ends up in landfills, and only a small fraction is recycled. The continuous dependence on landfills as the main disposal method for plastic waste is costly and ineffective. Common solutions to plastic waste management are incineration and recycling; however, incineration emits harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to ozone layer depletion and global warming; moreover, recycling is expensive and inefficient. As an alternative to recycling and incineration, the pyrolysis process can convert plastic wastes into more valuable fuel products. Pyrolysis is a thermal process that converts raw material into pyrolysis liquid, solid wax, and non-condensable gases in the absence of oxygen. This process is attractive because it is economical and energy-efficient, and it can be used to convert various types of plastic waste into valuable products. In recent years, there have been significant developments in pyrolysis applications in liquid fuel production from plastic wastes. This work reviews recent advances in and challenges for the pyrolysis process for converting plastic wastes into a valuable alternative fuel, focusing on studies of advanced pyrolysis processes published over the last five years. The paper also highlights the numerical modeling of pyrolysis of plastic wastes and the potential impact of pyrolysis on the future of sustainable waste-management practices of plastics."

With the expansion of urban populations, waste management systems grow increasingly complex, necessitating more sophisticated optimization strategies. This analysis thoroughly examines the optimization techniques used in solid waste management, assessing their application, benefits, and limitations by using PRISMA 2020. This study, reviewing the literature from 2010 to 2023, divides these techniques into three key areas: waste collection and transportation, waste treatment and disposal, and resource recovery, using tools like mathematical modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence. It evaluates these strategies against criteria such as cost-efficiency, environmental footprint, energy usage, and social acceptability. Significant progress has been noted in optimizing waste collection and transportation through innovations in routing, bin placement, and the scheduling of vehicles. The paper also explores advancements in waste treatment and disposal, like selecting landfill sites and converting waste to energy, alongside newer methods for resource recovery, including sorting and recycling materials. In conclusion, this review identifies research gaps and suggests directions for future optimization efforts in solid waste management, emphasizing the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration, leveraging new technologies, and adopting tailored approaches to tackle the intricate challenges of managing waste.

The microwave method enables a rapid, eco-friendly, and efficient synthesis of ZIF-8. Characterization tests including PXRD, FE-SEM, TGA, and FT-IR confirmed the high crystallinity and thermal stability of ZIF-8. To optimize the biosensor's performance, a 2<sup>3</sup> factorial design is pursued. The factorial design allows determining the individual and simultaneous effects of the control parameters such as ZIF-8 concentration, buffer pH, and solution temperature on the quenching efficiency. The results demonstrate that the parameters combination of 25 °C, pH 8.0, and 0.7 mg/mL ZIF-8 concentration results in the highest quenching percentage of 72.41 %. The study of the quenching mechanism confirms that the P-DNA can form electrostatic and π-π stacking interactions with ZIF-8, to produce a P-DNA@ZIF-8 complex.

Through employing a systematic literature review approach, PRISMA 2020, 113 articles published between 2019 and 2023 were analyzed using content and bibliometric analysis. The results of the content analysis show that the energy sector is the most extensively studied, with a focus on the integration of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and carbon capture technologies. Furthermore, results showed promising developments in energy-efficient electrification methods, and circular economy principles can be seen in the building, transportation, and industrial sectors. On the other hand, while having a large potential for sequestering carbon, the agriculture and forestry sectors are still understudied. As for the bibliometric analysis, this study reveals the complex interplay between technological innovation, sectoral strategies, and policy intervention in achieving carbon neutrality. It highlights the need for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches that consider interactions between technological, economic, social, and environmental factors. The analysis also emphasizes the importance of lifecycle assessment, economic complexity, and investments in shaping effective carbon neutrality strategies. As such, future research should address the identified gaps, particularly in agriculture and forestry, and develop more comprehensive models for the transition to carbon neutrality that incorporate both technological solutions and broader socio-economic considerations."

    "abstract": "Mangroves are an integral part of the coastal ecosystems, demonstrating resiliency against adverse anthropogenic and environmental effects. They provide blue carbon stock and security against coastal erosion and act as a nutrient source for many aquatic inhabitants along with providing raw materials for human consumption. However, mangroves continue to perish due to several climate factors. Past research has indicated some environmental factors influencing the growth and sustenance of mangrove forests. This paper aims to study the impact of the climate changes on the UAE mangrove forests during the period 1990–2020. The climate change related factors studied include surface temperature, sea-level rise, salinity, and coastal inundation. Here, remote sensing techniques and supervised machine learning methods were utilized to derive the climatic factors. The correlations between mangrove and these factors were investigated as well. It was revealed that Land Surface Temperature is closely related to mangrove and that mangrove biomass was highest in the land surface temperature range 30–35 °C. Results have not shown a clear correlation between tidal inundation and mangroves. Furthermore, outputs also showed that mangrove biomass was negatively affected by sea-level rise. The analysis showed a general positive relationship between mangrove and salinity corresponding to an increase in mangrove biomass which was only found when conducting spatial analysis, however site-specific analysis (i.e., temporal) showed an increase in mangrove density with decrease in salinity. These findings could potentially aid in facilitating the identification of suitable new sites for plantation or existing sites for rehabilitation of mangroves in UAE in addition to formulating policies at the highest level for mangrove conservation."

    "abstract": "In this work, a common household melamine sponge was impregnated with a novel hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (HDES) and used for the removal of phenol from aqueous media. The HDES was prepared from trihexyltetradecylposphonium chloride as a hydrogen bond acceptor and dodecanoic acid as a hydrogen bond donor. The modified sponge characterization was performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive (EDX) to confirm the presence of the HDES in the sponge, and assess the microscopic morphology of DES impregnated foam. The phenol adsorption over the hydrophobic sponge was investigated using batch adsorption experiments to examine the influence of the HDES loading (0.025–0.125 g), contact time (5–420 min), initial concentration of phenol (62–1000 mg/L), and temperature (25–45 °C) on the removal performance and kinetics. The phenol adsorption efficiency was found to decrease with temperature and increase with the initial concentration of aqueous phenol solution, contact time, and HDES load. The phenol adsorption efficiency of the native sponge increased to 469 mg/g after the HDES was loaded. Freundlich adsorption isotherm is more applicable than the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The kinetic study confirmed that the adsorption of phenol on the hydrophobic sponge follows a pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters represented the spontaneous adsorption of phenol on the hydrophobic sponge. Experimental results revealed that the modification of the surface of the melamine sponge with the reported HDES is an economical and efficient strategy for the adsorption of phenol from an aqueous solution."

    "abstract": "Urbanization in Jaipur, India, has led to a 42% decline in green cover over the past two decades, exacerbating urban heat, air pollution, groundwater depletion, and reduced livability. Green Infrastructure (GI) offers a sustainable solution, but effective implementation requires robust, data-driven strategies. This study employs geospatial technologies—GIS, remote sensing, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)—to develop a suitability model for Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) planning. Using an entropy-based weighting approach, the model integrates environmental factors, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which fell by 18% between 2000 and 2020; Land Surface Temperature (LST), which increased by 1.8 °C; soil moisture; precipitation; slope; and land use/land cover (LULC). Proximity to water bodies was found to be a critical determinant of suitability, whereas land surface temperature and soil moisture played significant roles in determining UGI feasibility. The results were validated using NDVI trends and comparative analysis with prior studies so as to ensure accuracy and robustness. The suitability analysis reveals that 35% of Jaipur’s urban area, particularly peri-urban regions and river corridors, is highly suitable for UGI interventions, thereby presenting significant opportunities for urban cooling, flood mitigation, and enhanced ecosystem services. These findings align with India’s National Urban Policy Framework (2018) and the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11, supporting climate resilience and sustainable urban development. This geospatial approach provides a scalable methodology for integrating green spaces into urban planning frameworks across rapidly urbanizing cities."

Despite their potential, the integration of sustainability into HEIs is often hindered by fragmented indicators, stakeholder misalignment, and implementation barriers. This study adopts a mixed-methods approach to identify and validate a comprehensive set of Sustainability Indicators (SIs) tailored to the HEI context, with a case study conducted at the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Derived from an extensive literature review, the indicators were validated through semi-structured interviews with key policymakers, revealing gaps in familiarity with sustainability indicators, financial constraints, technological resistance, and decentralized reporting systems. Participants emphasized the importance of environmental initiatives such as energy efficiency and sustainable procurement, while noting the comparatively limited focus on social equity (SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities) and economic dimensions (SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth). Following this, the Relative Importance Index (RII) was employed to analyze stakeholder perceptions through a survey of 81 stakeholders across three key groups (students, educators, and administrative staff) and to rank the indicators by their perceived impact. The findings reveal significant disparities in stakeholder priorities, underscoring the critical need for alignment across governance, environmental, social, economic, and academic pillars. Additionally, challenges such as cost-sustainability trade-offs and fragmented operations highlight the importance of fostering enhanced institutional communication and establishing centralized frameworks to ensure cohesive and effective sustainability efforts. This research offers actionable recommendations to address these barriers, including fostering targeted awareness initiatives, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and customizing sustainability frameworks to institutional contexts. By providing a replicable model, the study aligns institutional strategies with stakeholder needs, contributing directly to global sustainability objectives and reinforcing HEIs' role in advancing the UN SDGs."

The research investigates clay soil from Taxila Pakistan which received stabilization treatment by SBA and lime along with their combination at different mixing ratios. A series of geotechnical tests, including Atterberg limits, compaction tests, and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests, were conducted on both untreated and stabilized soil samples. SBA and lime were used in concentrations of 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% by dry soil weight, while their mixtures were applied in ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 1:2, and 1:3 at 5%, 7.5%, and 10% of dry soil weight. The results indicate that soil mixed with 7.5% SBA exhibited a 28% increase in the liquid limit, while the combination of 2.5% lime and 7.5% SBA resulted in a 40% increase in the plastic limit. The plasticity index improved by 42% with 7.5% SBA, and a mixture of 2.5% lime and 2.5% SBA significantly reduced soil plasticity, classifying it as low-plasticity soil. Moreover, the highest improvement (69%) in the CBR value was observed at 2.5% SBA and 5% lime mixture, which indicates the significant enhancement of the strength enhancements of the pavement soil. The cost analysis of the treated pavement shows that this method serves as an environmentally friendly practice that lowers roadway costs while prolonging service span and solving disposal issues through waste material conversion to SBA. The research findings confirm SBA alongside lime as an affordable sustainable stabilizer suitable for road construction projects that require clay soil improvement."

    "abstract": "Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is an attractive solution to the EV driving range limitations and the associated range anxiety problem. In DWC, charging lanes are deployed along city roads to wirelessly supply the needed charging power to EVs during their motion. However, due to the high construction costs of electrified road structures (ERS) with wireless charging lanes and the likely increase in the energy demand by EV owners, an optimal deployment plan is essential to maximize the net returns to the infrastructure owners and ensure maximal demand coverage. Therefore, to formulate a reliable optimization framework, accurate modeling of the charging lane operation is needed at each potential lane location. In this work, the traffic behavior at different locations is modeled analytically using queuing theory. This accurately represents the desired flow of vehicles on the charging lanes and provides a reliable estimate of the EV charging demand, particularly due to the lack of EV traffic flow datasets with the currently low but expanding penetration of EVs. A multi-objective optimization framework is then developed based on the established traffic model to determine the most optimal locations for the deployment of DWC lanes within a smart city infrastructure. The model is tested on 24 candidate roads selected from the United Arab Emirates map and the corresponding optimal locations are determined by solving the optimization problem on GAMS/CONOPT solver. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to validate the results of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "The sustainability of the construction industry largely depends on effective waste management practices throughout both construction and demolition processes. Construction and demolition waste causes significant environmental degradation, resource depletion, and landfill overflow, making effective waste management an essential component of sustainable construction practices. As the construction industry is one of the biggest contributors of generated waste in today’s world, achieving sustainability in this industry is essential for overall sustainable development. This study aims to examine the sustainable approach to construction and demolition waste and develop strategies for the industry. Based on the evaluation of various waste management techniques, this study used a standard approach in examining existing literature available in renowned research databases and key concepts to develop strategies for future construction and demolition waste management. This included identifying appropriate keywords or combining multiple keywords during the search process. Waste reduction and protecting the planet’s precious natural resources have been the focus of this study. This research investigated strategies during the planning and design phases. Out of the three strategies tested; reduction at the source, recycling, and reuse, source reduction yields the best results. Selecting materials, optimizing designs, and improving processes are all essential techniques for source reduction. Additionally, it explores the role of policy interventions and regulatory frameworks in improving source reduction practices across the industry. However, as waste reduction may not always eliminate waste generation, especially during the demolition of buildings, it is important to supplement this with existing recycling and reuse approaches. With the use of alternative building materials, it is essential to reassess recycling and reuse options for innovative and sustainable construction materials. The findings illustrate that efficient waste reduction regulations, such as green building certifications and mandatory waste management plans, are critical to achieving sustainability. By incorporating source reduction measures in addition to recycling and reuse of waste management, the construction may drastically minimize its environmental effect while increasing cost efficiency and resource usage. This study emphasizes that source reduction should be mandatory for accomplishing sustainable construction and demolition waste management. Recycling and reuse should complement waste reduction efforts."

Traditional hot mix asphalt (HMA) paving techniques are time-consuming and costly. The innovative approach of using precast asphalt slabs aims to reduce road closure times, improve quality, and minimize environmental impacts. This method involves off-site prefabrication of asphalt slabs followed by rapid on-site installation, reducing the need for heavy equipment and labor. Laboratory testing of various mixes and slab designs was conducted to meet ASTM standards, ensuring structural integrity and longevity. These tests included Marshall Stability (ASTM D6927), indirect tensile strength (ITS), and bulk specific gravity (ASTM D2041) to assess strength, durability, and compaction. The slabs were cured under shaded ambient conditions for 72 hours to ensure uniform cooling and reduced thermal cracking risk. The slabs incorporate modified polymer bitumen instead of conventional grades like 60/70 or 40/50, enhancing durability and flexibility. Geogrid reinforcement within the slab structure enhances structural integrity during loading, transportation, and installation. High-quality fibers added to the mix design increase tensile strength and crack resistance, mitigating shrinkage cracks and improving fatigue resistance. This combination results in robust slabs capable of withstanding installation and long-term service challenges under various conditions. Implementing this method could reduce maintenance costs by 30% and offer significant environmental benefits through reduced emissions and energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Seepage forces due to the flow of water inside embankment hydraulic structures, such as dams or levees, result in internal erosion or piping. This will result in a reduction in soil strength, causing the failure of hydraulic structures. Stabilization of the soil is one of the most effective approaches to avoid such catastrophic failure and prevent significant loss of life and property. The objective of this research is to stabilize sandy soil against internal erosion using fly ash (FA) alone and fly ash mixed with alkali-activated binder (NaOH). Although fly ash is commonly used for clay soil, its reactivity with alkali activators like NaOH makes it a potential candidate for stabilizing non-cohesive sandy soils when combined with alkaline solutions. A well-graded sandy soil was selected and mixed with fly ash alone and fly ash with sodium hydroxide at different percentages. Compaction curves were determined for each percentage, and specimens from the mix were remolded at 98% relative compaction and optimum moisture content corresponding to the compaction curve value. The hole erosion test (HET) was employed to evaluate internal erosion parameters. During the hole erosion test, seepage conditions were simulated by applying a controlled water flow through remolded specimens to replicate erosion caused by internal seepage forces. Additionally, the internal erosion parameters were evaluated at different curing times (2 days, 7 days, and 28 days were selected to capture short-term, intermediate, and long-term effects of chemical reactions on soil stabilization). Parameters such as the friction factor, coefficient of soil erosion, and critical shear stress were obtained, and the erosion rate index (I<inf>HET</inf>) was determined. It was found that using FA–NaOH significantly reduced internal erosion and increased the erosion rate index and the critical shear of the soil. The addition of 10% fly ash mixed with activated-alkali binder at 7 days curing time stabilized the soil against erosion. At this percentage, the erosion rate index equal to 5.3 and soil was categorized as: “very slow erosion”. However, mixing the sand with fly ash alone has a small or insignificant effect on the internal erosion of the soil, especially at higher percentages of fly ash. The optimum percentage of fly ash alone to improve the soil resistance to internal erosion was found to be 5% at 28 days of curing time where the soil rated as “moderately slow”."

This can be observed from the increasing number of zero food waste (ZFW) initiatives that are being adopted by communities and institutions, including universities. Food waste composting, in particular, is increasingly being used for food waste recovery on university campuses. Campus sustainability managers are often challenged with the interrelated impacts of economic and noneconomic factors when selecting a composting system and the sensitivity and risks involved in such a decision. Reviewed research highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of economic and operational feasibility in order to adopt an effective on-campus food waste composting system. This paper presents a methodological framework for assessing the feasibility of on-campus food waste composting systems. In addition to the composting project's economic feasibility, the framework utilizes the analytical hierarchy process to integrate noneconomic criteria into the assessment of composting alternatives. The framework then analyzes the sensitivity of the present worth of each composting system to projected changes in the economic parameters used. The framework also models the impacts of variability in the operational parameters of the composting system. Assessment values are then integrated into a normalized ranking of the alternative composting systems. The framework is illustrated through the assessment of three alternatives for installing on-campus food composters in a major university.

    "abstract": "Research into the delivery of sustainable construction projects has been gaining a lot of attention worldwide. Previous studies have shown that several countries embrace sustainable construction projects, but the uptake faces several delivery challenges. This research evaluates the factors that constitute challenges of sustainable construction projects delivery. A questionnaire survey was developed and distributed to construction professionals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to evaluate the significance of the challenges of sustainable construction projects delivery. Eighty-two questionnaires were returned and analysed. Out of the 33 challenges extracted from literature, factor analysis revealed seven clusters named, in other of significance, as financial, sustainable materials and technology, contractual, design, lack of experience, regulations, limited organizational awareness. This study recommends that mitigating these challenges will require modifying traditional project management practices, designing with a whole team approach, introducing contractual incentives, using an integrated project team and improving sustainability knowledge among stakeholders."

    "title": "Dynamic Properties of Calcareous Sands from Urban Areas of Abu Dhabi — Mousa Attom, Magdi El-Emam",
    "abstract": "Abu Dhabi (ABD) has recently developed its national building code that mandates dynamic analysis of large structures to seismic loadings. Large strain dynamic properties such as shear modulus (G) and damping ratio (D) of local undisturbed calcareous sands are not available. Designers are compelled to choose degradation models from studies on calcareous sands of other regions that are usually reconstituted. This research presents for the first time large strain dynamic properties of calcareous sands of urban ABD. Undisturbed samples are collected from different areas of urban ABD and are tested in cyclic triaxial (CT) devices fitted with bender elements (BE). The dynamic properties as functions of confinement are curve fitted with power models, whereas their variation with shear strain level is curve fitted with hyperbolic models. The results are compared with findings of previous studies on calcareous and silica sands. The results indicate that dynamic properties of all samples degrade with shear strain at almost the same rate irrespective of their spatial distribution. The proposed degradation models can therefore be used in dynamic analyses. The results from this study show smaller rates of degradation in dynamic properties compared to other studies on similar sands. The change in low-strain shear wave velocity (Vs) with confinement is significant among the tested samples; therefore, a site-specific evaluation of Vs is recommended. The dynamic properties of calcareous sands of ABD and previous studies however exhibit larger degradation with shear strain and a smaller increase in confinement compared to silica sands."

The objective of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how digital technology is making a headway in the construction industry as a consequence of COVID‐ 19. For the purpose of this paper, digital technology applications are divided into three groups: data acquisition, processing, and communication. The methodology involved conducting a question-naire survey among the construction professionals in the UAE. The survey included questions on the extent of use and level of investment on the three types of technology in three periods—pre‐ COVID, during COVID, and post‐COVID. The results clearly show the increasing level of usage of digital technology in the construction industry from pre‐COVID to during COVID and post‐COVID periods. Among the three categories, communication technology indicated higher extent of use as compared to the other two. In addition, a marked difference was observed between the “small” project organizations and the “large” ones. Unsurprisingly, both usage and investment in digital technology, in smaller organizations, indicated higher extent of increase in during and post‐pan-demic periods when compared to the larger organizations."

Content analysis of accident reports and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are the two main research tools used in this study. Content analysis is conducted based on a sample of 1700 historical accident reports occurred during 2019–2020 in UAE. The CFA is conducted based on a survey developed using the accident reports analysis and feedback from six experts with 290 respondents. The analysis revealed that falls, injuries due to contact with sharp edges, and burns are the most frequent accident types. The CFA analysis revealed that training enhancement and total safety operating system are viable solutions to aid in controlling the frequency and severity of these accidents."

Much of this can be attributed to inadequate decision making and follow-up within construction companies. To mitigate this problem, considerable research on Sustainable Development (SD) reports on decision support systems have been developed in order to make sound decisions with respect to the environment. Nonetheless, and despite the availability of such tools, these systems fail to track the commitment to SD decisions and goals during the different phases of construction projects in general and the design phase in particular. As such, this study identified three standard SD indicators: waste reduction, energy consumption, and carbon emissions as the main contributors, and developed the framework to track the project stakeholders’ commitment to the relevant SD indicators during the project design phase. The developed framework was validated via an expert panel and used to create a Sustainable Development Commitment Tracking Tool (SDCTT-D).

This paper devises two mixed-integer mathematical models along with efficient solution algorithms for the flexible multi-skill resource-constrained scheduling problem. Given the limited availability of multi-skill maintenance crew and the pressing need toward minimizing SM completion time, the proposed optimization models allow for the possibility of having a higher skilled worker perform a task requiring lower skill levels, if needed. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, two constructive heuristics are developed, with the second adopting a multi-start approach for an improved exploration of the feasible solution space. The quality of the two heuristics is assessed using 60 randomly generated test instances of various sizes and complexities. The practical relevance of the problem is also illustrated via an industrial case study drawn from the cement industry. Numerical results suggest an average reduction of 16.52% in shutdown completion time when flexible workers are better utilized. The results also demonstrate the efficiency of the heuristics as they quickly yield solutions that are within average deviations of 1.24% and 2.71%, respectively, from the optimally solved instances. Upon developing efficient lower bounds, Heuristic-2 yields solutions that are on average 0.22% and 4.1% away from the lower bound for large instances involving 100 and 200 tasks, respectively, where optimal solutions for such instances are not attainable within reasonable computational time."

In this regard, this work was undertaken to study the status of energy efficiency and conservation at a large school building in the northern part of United Arab Emirates (UAE). The annual electrical consumption at the school was analyzed and an awareness survey among the students and teachers was conducted to measure the level of awareness as well as to assess the current energy consumption practices. In order to identify energy saving opportunities, an energy audit was carried out wherein the school energy consuming systems, particularly the lighting and air-conditioning systems, were assessed. Furthermore, thermography scanning of the school building envelope was conducted to examine the building insulation and identify air leakage locations. The building electricity supply and distribution systems were assessed using power analyzer and thermography devices. The energy conservation measures identified include removing the extra lighting, installing motion sensors in classrooms and labs, as well as integrating a Networked Optimization Software with the current HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) system. The methodology consists of seven fundamental steps: (1) case study data collection (analysis of buildings and utility data); (2) survey of real operation conditions; (3) understanding of building behavior; (4) analysis of energy conservation measures; (5) estimation of energy-saving potential; (6) economic assessment; and (7) proposing Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). In this regard, the school energy consuming systems (lighting, building envelope, and air conditioning (AC)) were examined to identify possible ways to reduce the school energy consumption. The results indicate that the cost of installing motion sensors in classrooms, and labs is approximately AED 20,000 (United Arab Emirates Dirham), which yields an annual energy saving of AED 93,691. Furthermore, with all energy saving measures, a total annual saving of AED 364,000 is anticipated, which is approximately 16% of the annual electricity bill."

In these monitoring programs, the common practice is using fixed threshold limits to identify possible adverse conditions that may lead to undesirable consequences and delays in the corrective actions. This study proposes a statistical process control (SPC) approach integrating individual X and exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) charts to enhance the early detection of extreme readings and consequently, support the decision making process in the monitoring programs of deep excavations. The proposed SPC approach is demonstrated by a deep excavation case study in the heart of the congested business district in Dubai, UAE. The results reveal that the proposed SPC approach is considerably superior to the current practices for the early detection of adverse conditions and unanticipated shifts.

In addition, the lightweight of concrete is becoming a new requirement for sustainable development. This study aims to develop long carbon fibre (LCF) reinforced ultra-lightweight cementitious composites (ULCC) to address these issues. The mechanical properties and electrical and thermal conductivities of composites were investigated. The conductivity of LCF-reinforced ULCC under different testing methods (AC and DC), frequencies, temperatures, water content in the mixture, and curing ages were examined. The electromechanical properties of LCF-reinforced ULCC under compression (monotonic, cyclic loading under different loading peaks and loading rates) and tension were also tested. Except for the content, the effects of the pre-heating treatment of carbon fibre on the conductivity and electromechanical properties were compared. The experimental results revealed that LCF can remove the polarization effect and maintain the stability of the electrical conductivity of LCF-ULCC under different environments. The LCF can build a complete and continuously 3D conductive pathway, and free electrons can transport stably in the matrix, which can diminish the effect of electrolytic ions on the conductivity. The LCF-reinforced ULCC can show sensitive electromechanical ability where LCF is better used for self-sensing under tension when compared with compression. The conductivity of composites increases with increasing LCF content but initially increases and then decreases with increasing the pretreatment heating temperature of LCF. It is efficient to increase the conductivity and mechanical properties of composites by heating LCF to 300 °C. The composites (Oven-dry density: 990–1100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) are a good thermal insulation material and the thermal conductivity is between 0.35 and 0.45 W/mK.

Therefore, soil stabilization against internal erosion becomes necessary to prevent embankment failure. This paper aims to use lime to stabilize sandy soil against internal erosion. Two types of sandy soil (poorly graded and well-graded) were treated with different percentages of lime (based on the dry weight of the soil) and curing times (1 day, 2 days, and 7 days). For poorly graded soil, the different lime percentages used were from 0.0% to 6.0% with an increment of 1% by dry weight of soil. While for well-graded soil, the lime percentages used were 0.0%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0% by dry weight of soil. The hole erosion test (HET) was utilized to analyze the erosion parameters of the soil samples. Results proved that lime is an effective soil stabilization agent against the internal erosion of sandy soil. Moreover, for optimum stabilization against internal erosion, poorly graded and well-graded sandy soil required about 5.0% and 3.0% of lime, respectively, with a curing time of 2 days. Significant reduction in erosion rate and improvement in the erosion rate index and critical erosion stress were observed at optimum soil stabilization.

This paper presents a systematic review of the time-cost optimization models in construction management and proposes some future work to improve the solution of the considered problem. The review categorizes the existing models into three categories: exact models, approximate models, and hybrid algorithm models. The exact models provide optimal solutions but require a lot of computational time and may not be efficient in solving multi-objective and large-scale problems. The approximate models provide near-optimal solutions and reduce computational effort but may not be efficient in solving large-scale projects. The hybrid algorithm models combine the good properties of different algorithms to provide high-quality and efficient solutions. The purpose of this paper is accomplished through a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The paper analyzes the contribution, advantages, and limitations of each category and provides recommendations for future work. Based on the review, several recommendations for future work are provided, including the development of hybrid models that combine different optimization techniques, the incorporation of risk management into optimization models, and the use of advanced data analytics techniques to improve the accuracy of optimization models. Overall, this paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive review of the time-cost optimization models used in construction management and offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field. The findings of this review can be used to guide future research and improve the effectiveness of optimization models for construction projects."

The paper proposes several upgrade options to ensure that the hydraulic stability and wave overtopping discharges of the Palm Jumeirah revetment comply with the recommended design criteria based on industry guidelines. The performance of the existing revetment, in terms of the hydraulic stability and wave overtopping discharge criteria, is assessed using design wave heights (1- and 100-year events) extracted from an extreme wave analysis study on the Dubai coast. The results show that, based on the new design conditions, the existing structure should be upgraded to meet the armor stability criteria and recommended overtopping discharge values. Three different upgrade solutions are designed and analyzed to satisfy the required hydraulic stability and overtopping conditions. The suggested upgrade options are an extra armor layer, a flat berm, and a submerged breakwater offshore. The proposed upgrade solutions are preliminary designs that would require verification in terms of their geotechnical stability and physical model testing to evaluate their performance."

The system utilizes argon and carbon dioxide gases to control air composition and potassium chloride powder to manage humidity in a modified atmosphere storage system. Avocados and bananas were used in the experiments, and the results showed a significant improvement in the air quality inside the storage compartment, which significantly extended the shelf life of the fruits. A paired t-test was conducted, and the results showed that the air quality measurements inside the storage compartment were much lower than outside, with a paired difference in means of − 14.905 ppm (95% confidence interval: − 15.176 to − 14.634 ppm), rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference. Additionally, the results showed that 95.62% of the change in the air quality measurements inside the storage system was driven by the design variables, with time having the biggest effect and fruit type having the least effective. As for the air quality measurements outside the system, the results showed that 98.30% of the change was being driven by the design variables. The economic feasibility of the proposed system was also conducted, revealing a positive internal rate of return of 22% and a doubling of shelf life. These findings demonstrate the positive prospects of the proposed system in preserving the quality of fruits."

The study also measures the likelihood of the effects caused by these delays. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed approach of both qualitative and quantitative. Literature review was conducted to extract 40 factors of delays and 10 effects of delays. A survey was then administered to construction professionals in the UAE to collect the perceptions on the severity and frequency of factors of the causes of delays using a Likert Scale of 1–5 where 1 represented very low and 5 represented very high. Similarly, the respondents were also asked to rate the likelihood of the occurrence of the effects of the delays based on a Likert scale of 1–5 as well. Furthermore, Spearman’s rank correlation was also conducted to compute the level of agreement between the different parties; owner, consultants and contractors. Findings: The results revealed that the top five factors of delays include: award the project for the lowest bidder, delay in progress payment, change orders by the owner, poor subcontractor performance and inadequate planning and scheduling by the contractor. The findings of this study emphasize the financial challenges and economic crisis brought upon the construction industry due to the pandemic. Furthermore, the pandemic also shifted the perceptions of construction professionals, who are now more aware of the delays caused by awarding the project to the lowest bidder who would not have the required qualifications to conduct efficient planning and scheduling that are relevant in the case of extraordinary events such as Covid-19. Moreover, a high level of agreement between the consultants and contractors was observed, with a Spearman’s rank correlation of 0.804. Additionally, the most likely effects of delays concluded from this study were time overrun/extension and poor quality of work. Originality/value: Literature review is very rich in the field of construction projects delays. However, there is very limited research on the impact of Covid-19 in the context of construction projects delays, and insights from construction professionals regarding this matter are particularly lacking in literature. Therefore, this paper bridges the gap in literature by providing perceptions of construction professionals on the impact of Covid-19 on the factors causing delays in the UAE construction industry. The findings of this research are expected to be an invaluable resource for future to help the construction industry heal faster when encountering similar epidemics or extraordinary events."

    "abstract": "Environmental degradation is on the rise due to escalating pollution caused by raw material depletion and the increasing demand for concrete products. Consequently, researchers and scientists have dedicated significant efforts towards developing sustainable, eco-friendly concrete using renewable materials. Among these materials, Volcanic Ash (VA) and other Natural Pozzolana (NP) types have emerged as promising Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). VA and NP types play a crucial role in reducing costs, energy consumption, and environmental impacts associated with cement production. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the characteristics of VA and NP and their influence on the performance of concrete and cement mortar. This paper presents a comprehensive review of previous studies examining the effect of VA and other NP types on the mechanical properties of concrete while evaluating their chemical, physical, and microstructure characteristics. The findings from these studies indicate that the properties of concrete primarily depend on the characteristics and quantities of NP employed. Notably, silica dioxide (SiO<inf>2</inf>) comprises the predominant component in VA compositions. In most cases, an increase in VA and NP content within concrete mixtures leads to a reduction in strength. Finally, recommendations and suggestions for future research are provided to enhance concrete properties and achieve the development of sustainable construction materials."

The significance of these traditional selection criteria for project delivery methods indeed cannot be denied but this current list is far from comprehensive. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify and rank sustainability-specific criteria for the selection of project delivery methods. Nineteen criteria were identified that were grouped into five categories: level of integration, green liability, green contract, green team, technology and innovation. A survey was then administered to collect the perceptions of construction professionals in the United Arab Emirates about the significance of these sustainability-specific selection criteria. Thirty responses were collected and analyzed using relative importance index to identify the most significant sustainability-specific criteria. The results revealed that the top five sustainability-specific criteria include: early involvement of key participants, improve the ability to use full potential of BIM, efficiently utilize advanced technological tools to achieve sustainability, ability to use technology to enhance communication and allow for qualification-based procurement."

Specimens from the sand-glass waste mixtures were remolded at 90% relative compaction and optimum moisture content in the standard direct shear test mold. Direct shear test was performed to evaluate the shear strength properties of the sand mixed with crushed glass waste. Test results showed that the addition of the crushed glass waste decreased the optimum moisture content but had slight or no effect on the maximum dry density of the sand. The addition of crushed glass waste increased the shear strength of engineered sand at all percentages. The highest shear strength was noticed at 5% of sand-glass waste mixture at all crushed glass sizes. The main increase was noticed in the angle of internal friction of the sand.

    "title": "The use of treated desert sand in sustainable concrete: A mechanical and microstructure study — Farid Abed",
    "abstract": "Desertification stands as a major global issue, while the scarcity of renewable energy sources continues to be a growing concern. To address these challenges, the use of desert sand as a fine aggregate in sustainable concrete has been explored. Desert sand offers numerous advantages such as environmental protection, cost savings, and energy efficiency. This paper examines the impact of treated desert sand on the mechanical and microstructural properties of sustainable concrete. The results of this study reveal that the highest compressive strength was achieved with a 50% replacement level of treated desert sand. The concrete mixture with 50% desert sand achieved the highest 28-day compressive strength at 61.06 MPa. Conversely, the lowest 28-day compressive strength of 41.73 MPa was observed in the concrete mix containing 100% treated desert sand while the control mix with 0% treated desert sand attained a 28-day compressive strength of 48.7 MPa. As the proportion of treated desert sand increased, the workability of concrete decreased. The slump value, which was initially 130 mm for the control mix, dropped to 80 mm in the concrete mix composed of 100% treated desert sand. However, the flexural and tensile strengths tended to decrease as the amount of desert sand increased, particularly beyond a 25% replacement level. The addition of desert sand improves compactness and reduces pores in the samples, as observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy Analysis (EDS) analysis. The results suggest that desert sand can be effectively treated using different treatment methods and used as a fine aggregate in various applications within the construction industry. This research sheds light on the potential of desert sand in sustainable concrete production, contributing to environmental preservation and resource conservation efforts."

Supplementary cementitious materials, such as ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and silica fume (SF), were utilized for decreasing the cement quantity, enhancing the particle size distribution and improving packing. In sum, 130 concrete specimens—cubes, cylinders, and prisms—from 10 different concrete mixes were tested to determine the enhancement levels in the fresh and hard properties of new concrete. The results showed the improved particle packing of the concrete, especially within the region of sizes 100–10,000 microns, produced by the Elkem Materials Mix Analyser (EMMA), closely matching the Andreassen theoretical model. The green concrete incorporating SF and GGBS possessed air content in the range 1.0–1.4% and compressive strength that is on average 11% higher than the well-packed concrete that did not contain SF or GGBS. Compared to the ACI 318 code’s predictions, the experimental findings of the optimally packed concrete’s moduli of rupture and elasticity were under-estimated by 55–69% and 0.8–8.8%, respectively. The rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) showed results as low as 392 coulombs for mixes with supplementary cementitious materials, indicating very low chloride permeability. Microstructural analysis using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that concrete with supplementary materials has fewer voids, more homogeneous integration of ingredients, and an abundance of C-S-H products that supported the RCPT findings and tests of mechanical properties. The study demonstrated a significant decrease in carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions of concrete utilizing GGBS and SF and the financial feasibility of eco-friendly concrete in the UAE."

Fortunately, these adverse environmental impacts can be minimized and counteracted by carrying out sustainable construction projects. As sustainable construction projects gain more popularity and are increasingly in demand, it is crucial for those who will execute these projects to be knowledgeable about the nature of sustainable construction projects and be able to determine whether to bid for these projects. The bidding decision is one of the critical decisions that contractors have to make due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding this choice. Given the above challenge, this research aims to identify the most significant factors that affect the bidding decision in sustainable construction. The methodology adopted in this research is a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis. An extensive literature review was first conducted to determine the bidding decision factors. After that, a survey was distributed to United Arab Emirates (UAE) construction professionals, where they were asked to rank the significance of the 40 extracted factors. The weighted average approach was then used to prioritize the most significant factors of the bidding decision in sustainable construction. The results showed that the top 10 ranking factors were as follows: client’s financial capabilities, client’s payment history, client’s reputation, project risks, contractor’s financial capabilities, project complexity, experience in similar projects, project type, contractor’s access to technologies required to execute sustainable projects, and material availability. The findings of this research can benefit contractors and subcontractors by increasing their understanding of the major factors affecting the bidding decision in sustainable construction. Contractors armed with such invaluable information will be better equipped to reach more effective better bidding decisions."

To validate the model, Oil & Gas industry is surveyed, where a total of 207 responses are obtained from maintenance experts in the Gulf region. The results of the study support the indicators’ reliability as well as the first-order constructs’ internal consistency, convergent validity and discriminant validity. An embedded multistage approach for the higher-order constructs measurement models evaluation reveals that they exhibit satisfactory levels of quality. The structural model evaluation supports the significance of the hypothesized paths, a strong degree of predictive relevance, and the hypothesized mediation relationships proved significant. Finally, the total effect analysis demonstrates that “Energy Use” has the highest effect among first-order variables followed by “Material use”, ‘Costs & Returns”, “Emission & Pollution”, and “Effluents & Waste”. Furthermore, “Energy Use” related indicators have the highest weights among all indicators. This study provides empirical evidence on the causal background of the proposed model's implicated elements on sustainable performance of maintenance. The findings offer guidance to practitioners in this area and useful insights to decision-makers, as it enables them to determine the inherent impacts of the model components on the overall performance and allocate resources efficiently to increase the maintenance sustainability level."

Thirty-six key selection criteria were first identified, through literature review, and then divided into traditional and sustainability-specific categories. The relative weights of these selection criteria were then assessed using an analytic hierarchy process through a survey administered to construction professionals. The results indicated that the three most important groups of selection criteria were level of integration, technology, and innovation, in addition to scope-related criteria. Another questionnaire survey was administered to evaluate the effectiveness of the three common delivery methods - design-bid-build (DBB), design-build (DB) and construction management at risk (CMR) - in achieving the 36 identified selection criteria.

    "abstract": "Urbanization is caused by the rapid rise in the global population, contributing to the rapid depletion of naturally available resources. This exerts great pressure on the land near urban areas, which covers about 6% of the overall globally available land and must expand to allow for this growth. In the context of the Middle East, and the UAE, specifically in Sharjah, this study will focus on land suitability. Different criteria are considered for land-use selection which depends on the purpose of the used land, such as location, infrastructure, service, size, community services, and people preferences. All these criteria are assessed using multicriteria decision-making analysis (MCDM) to rank, prioritize, and weigh the factors. The aim of this paper is to develop a land suitability assessment tool (LSA) using AHP as an MCDM method to assess the suitability of the residential land in Sharjah city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) based on resident preferences in Sharjah. Finally, to propose and develop a platform for residential area selection in Sharjah city. The finding showed that the Emirate of Sharjah is in dire need of a tool to measure the suitability of residential lands. Streetlights and accessibility to the main roads are the two main criteria when choosing residential land in Sharjah based on people's preferences."

This study examines the effect of near-fault ground motions on reinforced concrete bridges, specifically the variation in the seismic performance with the height, aspect ratio, and longitudinal reinforcement. A suite of 332 near-fault ground motions is used to evaluate the performance of 60 bridge models in OpenSees, and the seismic responses are measured in terms of pier curvature ductility, maximum bearing deformation, and deck displacement. Linear regression analysis is used to generate probabilistic seismic demand models and fragility curves corresponding to different damage states. Expected behaviors are displayed within the models grouped with respect to height classes. Since the column diameters are based on aspect ratios, the effect of taller columns reduces the exceedance probabilities. This brought forward a need to define the damage states for tall columns in a manner different from short or medium columns. Moreover, this study underscores the need to update HAZUS fragility median values for near-field seismic response of RC bridges."

However, there has been a scarcity of substantial research efforts to examine the influence of plastic waste on the properties of concrete. The current study aims to undertake a comprehensive review of the findings from previous research endeavors, with a specific focus on the period between 2020 and 2024, to investigate the potential of utilizing plastic waste as an aggregate in cement concrete components. To present a comprehensive review of this study, the literature pertaining to the use of plastic waste as aggregates in cement concrete has been examined and analyzed. The key types of plastic waste and their recycling as aggregates in concrete mixtures are briefly discussed. The physical and mechanical properties of these plastics and their impact on the mechanical and durability properties of concrete were evaluated, as well as their economic benefits and the limitations to their usage. The results indicate that the addition of specific categories of plastic waste enhances the workability and reduces the density, compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths of concrete to acceptable levels compared to the control samples. The incorporation of plastic waste into the cement concrete matrix leads to significant economic benefits by reducing the consumption of raw materials and the emission of CO<inf>2</inf> into the atmosphere. The addition of plastic waste as an aggregate in concrete mixtures can also decrease the thermal conductivity property of concrete. Furthermore, the durability properties can be improved with the incorporation of a small quantity of plastic waste. Additionally, the use of plastic waste as an aggregate in concrete mixtures has the potential to reduce production costs and alleviate environmental pollution for a cleaner environment. Therefore, this investigation concludes that the appropriate utilization of plastic waste in construction projects can greatly enhance sustainability and mitigate the adverse impact of plastic waste on the environment."

However, the use of computer vision and machine learning (ML) has the potential to streamline and improve this process. This study investigates the integration of geographic information systems (GIS), aerial imagery, and ML to enhance pavement maintenance requirements by developing a pavement condition assessment rating (PCAR) based on remote sensing, severity level, and crack percentages. The objective of this paper is to identify roads with and without cracks to determine the PCAR for effective planning and resource allocation. A systematic workflow included data collection, preprocessing, support vector machines (SVM) classification, accuracy assessment, and visualization. Twelve satellite images (0.25 ft resolution) from the USGS database covered part of Newington, Connecticut. The reclassified model achieved an overall accuracy of 72% with a substantial correlation (kappa coefficient of 67%). The roads with cracks had a producer accuracy of 80%, indicating that the algorithm successfully identified and included 80% of the reference pixels belonging to this class. After this, the PCAR was obtained, e.g., Cambria Avenue had a cracking area percentage of 26.72%, with a PCAR classified as “Fair”, while roads like Adrian Avenue showed lower cracking area percentages, indicating PCAR of “Good”. The results highlight the effectiveness of ML and aerial imagery for classifying roads and obtaining PCAR. These findings assist in prioritizing road maintenance decisions while converting crack percentages into severity indices and aid in assessing pavement conditions and planning rehabilitation efforts."

One of the core project management decisions that affect the success of these projects is the selection of the project delivery method. Extensive effort has been witnessed in literature to study the impact of traditional selection criteria of project delivery methods on traditional construction projects. However, these results are incompatible with sustainable construction projects as they have their own unique challenges that are different and more complex than their traditional counterparts. Therefore, there is a need to re-evaluate the impact of these traditional selection criteria on the success of sustainable construction projects. In order to bridge this gap, a partial least square structural equation model was used to model the correlation between the exogenous traditional selection criteria variables and their corresponding latent variables as well as predict the hypothesized paths between the traditional section criteria and sustainable project success criteria. The results concluded that cost criteria group had the highest impact on achieving the sustainability success criteria group, while project's characteristics had the highest impact on achieving efficiency, team effectiveness and client satisfaction. Additionally, having a flexible well-defined scope and capitalizing on a qualification-based approach rather than the conventional lowest cost approach are crucial to the success of sustainable construction projects."

    "title": "Coupling and Quantifying Sustainability and Resilience in Intelligent Buildings — Maruf Mortula",
    "abstract": "Over recent years, the sustainability and resilience concept has increased its significance in the construction industry. Sustainability is associated with implementing best practices in the construction industry, while resilience is the adaptability and tolerance of systems in harsh conditions. The concepts are learned in the construction process. Moreover, building automation is growing rapidly, and buildings are becoming increasingly dependent on complex systems and technology and susceptible to unanticipated failure. Though sustainability and resilience concepts are interlinked, limited research quantifies their combination, resulting in a limited comprehension of how both concepts interact during application by developers in a smart building. Therefore, this study has established a financial model that employs Net Present Value (NPV) in studying the inference and clampdown of investment in both concepts. NPV was estimated using indirect and direct costs and benefits derived from the continuous integration of sustainability and resilience in a smart building. To quantify sustainability, its three components had to be quantified. Reduced energy expenditure and government environmental incentives were used to calculate the environmental component. Workers’ cost savings, fire insurance cost savings, and additional system maintenance costs were used to calculate the economic component. The social component of sustainability measured hard-to-quantify attributes like productivity, indoor environment quality, reputation, extra profit, services, and safety. To quantify them, a survey and RII method were used. The two concepts were then coupled by estimating the benefits and costs of installing and keeping resilience tools in design that are sustainable in the smart building and the impact study on the NPV outcome. Application of the design model was also carried out on four smart buildings that were selected in Dubai. The result indicated that coupling sustainable approaches and resilience yields higher NPV by at least 22%. Nevertheless, for NPV to be maintained positively and reduce the cost of failure, faulty detection tools should be assimilated while designing sustainable and smart buildings. The findings of this study will contribute to the benefit of other researchers, developers, investors, managers, engineers, and anyone who is involved in the design or construction process of intelligent buildings."

In such concrete, little or no sand is employed in the mix in order to allow the formation of considerable void content leading to high permeability. In this study, seven pervious concrete mixes made with recycled coarse aggregate and containing different amount of natural fine aggregate are tested in the laboratory for their strength. The source of the coarse aggregate is demolished old concrete buildings in the United Arab Emirates. One of the mixes contains 100% natural coarse aggregate without natural sand, another 100% recycled coarse aggregate without natural sand, and the remaining 5 mixes include both recycled coarse aggregate and fine natural aggregate such that the amount of fine-to-coarse aggregate is 1.5-11.7%. Results of the study revealed that that the use of recycled coarse aggregate in pervious concrete without fine aggregate reduced the compressive strength by 36% and tensile strength by 57%. Replacing 4.7% of the recycled coarse aggregate with natural sand in such concrete helped in restoring the compressive strength to the level of the control mix that contained natural coarse aggregate. Likewise, replacing 11.7% of the recycled coarse aggregate with natural sand in concrete mix aided in restoring the split cylinder tensile strength to the level of the control mix that contained natural coarse aggregate. There is a relationship between compressive and tensile strengths, of which a lower bound can be reasonably predicted by models proposed for pervious concrete in the literature. The study confirms the feasibility of using recycled aggregate in pervious concrete mixes if about 10% natural fine aggregate is utilized in the mix as replacement of the recycled coarse aggregate."

The research method employed involves calculating the EE, EC, and cost of materials used during the production stage only. The results show that although RMC gives ease at a high carbon emission cost, RPC delivers great strength at a high cost and emissions. Utilizing waste resources, geopolymer concrete lowers emissions while providing sustainability. Reusing waste materials improves the performance of concrete and lowers pollution. The study emphasizes that, especially when waste is used well, strength need frequently translate into expense. RMC has a major negative influence on the environment while guarantees consistent quality. Despite its strength, RPC has issues with cost and material availability. The strength and emission reduction of geopolymer concrete are excellent. In geopolymers, alkali activators and steel fibers are the source of EE and EC, whereas cement and steel fibers are the reason for their high levels in RMC and RPC. Overall, the research indicates that favorable, ecologically friendly results are feasible obtained by improving the composition of concrete.

This paper further discusses living building strategy as an emerging method for creating dynamic and adaptable spaces by prioritizing user experience through co-creation and focusing on sustainable and regenerative structures. The potential of integrating these approaches is emphasized using laboratory buildings as an example, with nature-inspired and living laboratories serving as models for future built environments that promote both environmental responsibility and a positive human experience. Accordingly, this work aims to investigate the design and construction of laboratory buildings based on nature-inspired design strategies and the living building concept. Moreover, the paper discusses the application of biomimicry and living building concepts within laboratory buildings as a novel contribution to the body of knowledge, and concludes by proposing the Nature-inspired & Living Laboratory (NILL 1.0)<sup>TM</sup> Building Assessment index to serve as a guideline for the design and construction of laboratory buildings using nature as an inspiration and the analogy of human body systems."

    "abstract": "Meeting the requirements of the construction market and addressing the scarcity of virgin materials pose significant challenges in increasing the required concrete amounts for construction projects. This study explores the workability, density, and strength properties of sustainable concrete containing partial replacement of natural sand with iron ore waste (IOW) as a fine aggregate. In the first group, four concrete mixtures were prepared using different percentages of IOW (0 %, 15 %, 30 %, and 60 %) to replace natural sand. Basalt fiber was added into the second group of four concrete mixtures to enhance fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) in the volume of 2 % of the cement weight. High volume of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) including fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF) were used to replace cement in proportions of 35 % and 15 %, respectively to achieve sustainable concrete with low cement content. The results obtained show that an increase in replacement levels of IOW led to a decrease in the slump value of the concretes, from 120 mm to 80 mm, with a reduction rate of 33 %. The addition of 30 % IOW as fine aggregate led to an increase in the compressive strength of concretes by 47.34 %. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the high porosity of IOW contributed to these changes in concrete properties. It is recommended to optimize concrete mixes based on the specific needs of civil engineering applications. This includes selecting different mix designs tailored for the desired structural performance, durability, and environmental conditions. Using IOW as fine aggregate in the concrete mix will help conserve resources for the next generations and enhance waste management, leading to greater sustainability in the construction industry."

In this regard, mangrove-based carbon market projects (MbCMP), involving mangrove conservation, protection, and restoration, are a nature-based solution (NbS) for climate change mitigation. Despite the proliferation of blue carbon projects, a highly publicized need for local community participation by developers, and existing project implementation standards, local communities are usually left out for several reasons, such as a lack of capacity to engage in business-to-business (B2B) market agreements and communication gaps. Local communities need to be engaged and supported at all stages of the MbCMP development process to enable them to protect their ecological, economic, and social interests as custodians of such a critical ecosystem. In this paper, we provided 15 strategic considerations and recommendations to engage and secure the interests of local communities in the growing mangrove carbon market trade. The 15 considerations are grouped into four recommendation categories: (i) project development and community engagement, (ii) capacity building and educational activities, (iii) transparency in resource allocation and distribution, and (iv) partnerships with local entities and long-term monitoring.

There have been several research works that have investigated the integration of sustainability in construction. However, there is a gap in addressing performance measurement and evaluation during the construction phase. Traditional project performance evaluation methods use the Earned Value Management (EVM) technique to assess time, cost, and scope performance. However, EVM does not address the performance of sustainability goals. The main objective of this paper is to develop a new project controls method for sustainable construction projects. Sustainability performance indicators can play an essential role in advancing the practice of sustainable construction. Accordingly, a Sustainable Earned Value Management (SEVM) model incorporating sustainability indicators was developed to monitor the attainment of sustainability objectives in construction projects in addition to the traditional objectives. The proposed SEVM model uses the construction planning optimization model to prepare the baseline plan to monitor the project’s time, cost, and sustainability performance. The proposed model enhances the monitoring and control of sustainable construction projects in terms of time, cost, and sustainability using sustainability indicators."

This study aims to understand the performance levels (compressive strength), environmental impact, and overall sustainability of three concrete mixes, two of which use recycled materials. The mixes are defined as a conventional mix, mix one, which replaces dune sand for recycled rubber in the mix design, and mix two, which utilizes recycled aggregate as a replacement for fine aggregates. SEM-EDS is used to assess the elemental composition and surface morphology of the materials. The potential leaching of pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-targeted organic compounds, and heavy metals was obtained using GC/MS and ICP-OES. The results showed low concentrations of PAHs in all mixes and a low calculated Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI), where the conventional mix and mix two had the lowest risk (55 and 33, respectively) compared to mix one, which displayed a higher risk of 125. The results of the heavy metals assessment yielded that mix one was the most contaminated, with 1535 mg/kg of nickel and 1200 mg/kg of zinc, followed by the conventional mix, with 1385 mg/kg of nickel and 135.5 mg/kg of chromium, and finally, mix two was the least contaminated with 378.5 mg/kg of nickel and 142.5 mg/kg of zinc. Overall, the sustainability potential showed that mix two, with the recycled aggregates, was the most sustainable, with a Building Material Sustainability Potential (BMSP) value of 9.25. The study advocates for a shift toward sustainable concrete practices to mitigate environmental impacts while maintaining structural integrity."

In order to determine how well typical delivery methods—Design-Bid-Build (DBB), Design-Build (DB), and Construction Management at Risk (CMR)—meet the nomination factors, a poll was subsequently sent to construction experts in the United Arab Emirates. Paired analyses of the three delivery systems were performed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The results showed that DBB, the traditional delivery technique, is not up to the increased needs for integration and collaboration in sustainable construction projects. Alternative delivery techniques, like CMR and DB better meet these needs. Three functions make up the suggested decision support model: screening of nomination factors, evaluation of project delivery methods, and strategic alignment of project goals and project delivery methods nomination factors. Users of this model can alter the weights assigned to the nomination factors that are essential to accomplishing the objectives of their green construction projects.

This sector, characterized by its diverse and dynamic environment, is crucial in job creation across various domains, including transportation, real estate, manufacturing, trade, warehousing, wholesale, and leasing services. Employing about one quarter of the global workforce, its significance is undeniable. Despite its pivotal role, the construction sector grapples with significant mental health and social sustainability challenges. Reports in recent years indicate that approximately one in four individuals worldwide experiences various forms of mental disorders. A study by the Global Burden of Disease in 2010 revealed that around 400 million people globally suffer from depression with projections suggesting that depression could be the leading cause of employee mortality by 2030. This underscores the critical need to address mental health and well-being issues in this sector. While the existing literature has presented numerous studies and reliable scales linking employee mental health and well-being to factors such as job satisfaction, productivity, absenteeism, and low turnover rates, these studies often operate in isolation, concentrating on specific aspects of mental health. This study views mental health and well-being as essential parts of defining social sustainability as a comprehensive concept. Moreover, limited research has been conducted to assist organizations in decision making and facilitate efforts to enhance the social sustainability of employees in the construction sector, highlighting a noticeable research gap. To address this gap, our study adopted a comprehensive mixed-methods approach, incorporating semi-structured interviews, surveys, and structural equation modeling to identify the underpinning criteria that define the social sustainability of employees. This study accordingly incorporated the identified criteria to evaluate the relationship and impact of these factors on employees’ job satisfaction, ultimately contributing to the assurance of social sustainability for employees within the construction sector in the UAE.

The United Arab Emirates building, and construction sector consumes 70% of the entire country’s electricity demand and uses large amounts of raw materials, accelerating resource scarcity. The tiny house offers several environmental and sustainability benefits that have contributed to its growing popularity. Methods: In this study, the environmental impacts of a tiny house, built on the American University of Sharjah campus will be evaluated using life cycle impact assessment. A cradle-to-grave evaluation was conducted for the life cycle assessment of the tiny house, with a functional unit of 1 m<sup>2</sup>, using the ReCiPe 2016 V1.03 midpoint method. Results: The environmental impact associated with the production and operational phases was most severe, aligning with similar studies on residential buildings. In the material production phase, concrete and steel had the most significant environmental impacts, particularly in the climate change category. These results highlight the importance of focusing on sustainable innovations in material production and recycling to mitigate environmental impacts. The operational phase contributed to approximately 77% of the total carbon dioxide emissions over the 50-year lifespan of the tiny house, primarily due to energy consumption for heating and cooling. Discussion: While the findings align with previous studies on residential buildings, it is important to consider the context of a tiny house; its small size results in a significantly lower overall environmental impact compared to larger homes."

With the weather instability driven by the effects of climate change, many normally dry lands are facing an increase in rainfall-induced floods. The expected lack of preparedness in these cities to handle floods raises concerns regarding the possible impacts on regular civilian's lives. This problem requires a thorough analysis of cities' ability to keep critical infrastructure safe, accessible, and easy to reach during disrupting events such as floods. In this study, we propose a new methodology to analyze the impact of floods on arid cities' critical infrastructure using open data. We showcase our methodology on the city of Dubai which was hit by a thunderstorm earlier this year causing nation-wide floods. Our quantitative analysis was capable of determining that the Al Quoz area suffered the most from floods due to issues related to the city's connectivity and critical infrastructure distribution. The main road connecting both sides of the area was completely blocked due to the floods with distant alternative connections while critical infrastructure was mainly concentrated on one of the two sides only. This resulted in a high increase in travel time delay and lower reachability scores. On the other hand, the Airport and Trade Center areas show a high reachability and low travel time delays as per the results obtained."

These floods inevitably have adverse impacts on the built environment and have resulted in immense financial damage and a sizable number of fatalities globally. Henceforth, resilience against floods is of paramount significance in the built environment. Specifically, 'resilience' in the design of buildings has become a growing theme and is deemed a powerful tool for survivability against the current climate crisis. Similarly, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is also becoming vulnerable to meteorological disasters such as floods, which are aggravated by the substantial urbanization occurring. Therefore, the adoption of resilient design strategies in building design is a mandatory undertaking in the UAE. For the successful implementation of resilience in buildings, a thorough understanding of what resilience is in a building design context is vital. However, in the UAE, there is still no clear understanding of what resilience is in the construction industry or what criteria are essential for designing resilient buildings, and this is attributed to the lack of tools that could assist in the implementation of resilient building design strategies. Designing for resilience is a significant challenge and therefore, scholars have emphasized the importance of implementing suitable decision support tools to guide the stakeholders in the construction industry to successfully achieve favorable resilient design decisions. Accordingly, upon reviewing the previously conducted research and frameworks that discuss the various applications of design strategies for resilient buildings to counteract the risk of catastrophes such as floods, this paper aims to underpin the criteria that define the application of resilience in the different building components and subsequently propose a suitable Decision Support Tool, namely, a Hybrid Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) that will assist decision-makers with making strategic decisions to ensure the implementation of resilience in the different building components in the UAE."

The results indicated a positive relationship and showed that the area under the curve was 88.4%, for the RF model. Thus, application of the approach using different algorithms could improve the performance of the modelling and the accuracy of the produced maps. The results of this study not only permit a better understanding of the impact of human activity and excessive groundwater extraction on ground surface stability, but also assist in enhancing geohazard mitigation strategies."

Five archetype buildings ranging from 2 to 16 floors were meticulously modeled to represent the most common buildings stock. The seismic performance of the reference buildings was assessed using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The IDA was performed as per a methodology from current standards and far-field ground motion records. Fragility curves were developed for three damage states, namely Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS), and Collapse Prevention (CP). At the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) level, the economic losses due to structural damage were estimated based on accepted standard current values. Human losses and injuries were projected using a methodology from current standards. Finally, corresponding seismic risk maps were generated. The seismic risk maps illustrate that the estimated number of fatalities and major injuries at the MCE level is generally low."

    "abstract": "Seepage analysis plays a key role in geotechnical engineering and contributes significantly to the success of its infrastructure projects. Several engineers consider the Finite element (FE) method basics when executing calculations for designing hydraulic structures and dams. Numerical methods are used herein to solve the problem of seepage flow of water under concrete dams. The FE method is applied to model the dam structure and water level. The seepage velocity distribution in the porous soil is determined, and the effects of varying multiple parameters on the velocity are studied. The different parameters investigated are the dam dimensions (i.e., width (4,8,10,15 m) and depth (0,2,4,8 m)), upstream water head level (10, 15, 20 m), soil permeability (10, 15, 20 m day<sup>−1</sup>) and ambient temperature (5 °C and 50 °C). The developed FE models were validated by carrying out comparisons with analytical solutions that showed that they were in good agreement. It was found that the dam width is inversely proportional to the seepage rate and is independent of the water head level where increasing the dam by 1 unit width drops the seepage by 3.7% regardless of the water head levels. The depth of the dam is exponentially related to the distance away from the toe and independent of both the dam’s width and water head level. Increasing the dam depth reduces the seepage flow by 73% at shallower depths and the effect minimizes as we increase the depth to 1% reduction in seepage simulating an exponential behavior. Such behavior is typical for the dam depth factor regardless of the dam width and water head level variations used in the study. The water head level was also found to be linearly proportional to the seepage flow rate with an increased effect of about 10% per additional 1-m head level. In addition, the soil permeability is linearly proportional to the seepage rate, and the same increment is obtained regardless of the dam’s dimensions and water head level. The effects of ambient temperature on the seepage flow were introduced in this paper and will be further studied in detail in our future simulations. Our study concludes that the developed FE model can predict the seepage flow of water under concrete dams with a reasonable level of accuracy."

This study presents the results of a hydrodynamic model applied to these lagoons to determine water circulation and flushing time variability, both at present, and in a future with a projected 1m sea level rise (SLR) over the next 100 years. The results show that a 1m SLR would increase the tidal range by 35% and raise the velocity of currents inside the lagoon from an average speed of 0.31 m/s (present) to 0.43 m/s (future), with maximum currents of 1.4 m/s occurring near the tidal inlet during the flood tide and 0.8 m/s during ebb tide. This increase in tidal velocity would also increase the rate of water circulation in the lagoons, significantly reducing the local flushing time. The present conditions revealed that inner areas of the lagoon experience increased local flushing times compared to the outer regions of the lagoon, which may impact water quality status in the inner sectors. Overall, in the model, the local flushing time was reduced from 27 days (present) to 14 days (future), reflecting a 50% reduction. This would suggest that a 1m SLR would result in a more efficient dispersal of materials out of the lagoons."

To explore the use of WVR-retrieved tropospheric delay and assist other geodetic techniques for atmospheric correction, the tropospheric delay from WVR and co-located GPS at Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, and Urumqi stations in China are compared. For the inconsistent values of WVR-PPP zenith wet delay, the variations of the tropospheric delay from WVR and GPS before and after the rainfall were statistically analyzed. The results suggest that, for the rain rate ranging from 0.1 to 50 mm/hr, the impact of rainfall on WVR could last from 10 min before to 30 min after the rainfall. With filtering WVR data based on meteorological parameters and rain rate, the zenith wet delay between WVR and PPP at Shanghai shows good consistency, the root mean square (RMS) is 6.11 mm, correlation is 0.997, and the RMS in the other three stations ranges from 16.35 to 25.16 mm (correlation ranges in 0.794–0.951).

The Hole Erosion test was conducted to determine the internal erosion parameters: the erosion rate index and the critical shear. Another set of specimens with the same initial dry unit weight and water content was remolded in the direct shear box and tested using the direct shear test to determine the shear strength parameters (i.e., the cohesion and the angle of internal friction). The various physical properties of soil (initial dry unit weight, initial water content, plastic index, liquid limit, optimum water content, maximum dry density, cohesion, and angle of internal friction) were used to develop models that predict both the erosion rate index and the critical shear. The findings show that the initial physical properties can be used to predict the erosion rate index and the critical shear. The coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was found to be between 0.83 and 0.92 to predict the erosion rate index and between 0.85 and 0.9 to predict the critical shear. The high R<sup>2</sup> implies that the models can be used to rate the soil erodibility in advance based on simple laboratory testing instead of time-consuming tests. Additionally, the findings give varied options for prediction depending on the availability of the soil initial physical properties."

The model was developed using the finite element software ANSYS, based on equivalent thermal analysis and correlation with seepage performance. The issue of water seepage under concrete dams is addressed mathematically. In this study, the effects of several parameters on porous soil seepage velocity distribution are studied. Sheet pile parameters were varied in depth, location and number of sheet piles. The sheet pile with variables of 0, 1, 2, and 3 pieces, location of 0, 0.5, and 1 of dam width, and the depth of the sheet piles varying as 2 and 4 m, respectively. The developed FE models were verified by a previous study and used for further parametric studies. It was concluded that increased sheet pile depth reduces the seepage flow. In addition, the location of the sheet pile is an important factor in seepage velocity, as it might increase the flow away from dam toe in a similar fashion to dam depth effects. Moreover, increasing the number of sheet piles further reduces the seepage velocity in comparison to usage of a single sheet pile. The sheet pile configuration and parameters are integrated with each other and each factor influence the others, resulting in various seepage flow patterns. This study demonstrates that FE modeling can effectively predict seepage flow under concrete dams with sheet piles."

Sea level rise can lead to flooding of low-lying coastal areas, land and wetland losses, increased coastal erosion, groundwater and soil salinization, and environmental degradation. It is evident that a substantial relationship exists between sea level rise and coastal erosion and that the rate of coastal erosion is about tens to hundreds of times that of the land loss due to sea level rise. Storm surges also increase resulting from the long-term sea level rise, adversely affecting coastal regions. The UAE has a 1300 km long shoreline that runs mainly along the Arabian Gulf and it is the home to several manmade islands, and highly populated coast. These islands, along with the coastal area surrounded by the sea, could be at risk of flooding due to sea level rise. This paper presents the results of a coastal vulnerability study of the UAE coast due to possible significant sea level rise. The study used sea level data collected at five gauges along the coast of Dubai in 2004–2019. This data was combined with coastal slope, coastal geomorphology, erosion rates, and the coastal bathymetry to develop a GIS-based Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) map. The analysis based on the CVI map showed that the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise are those located from the middle of Dubai coast to Umm Al Quwain, and all the way to Ras Al-Khaimah including the coast located on the Gulf of Oman.

The loads are dynamically clustered, a process where similar loads are grouped together based on their characteristics and scheduled for one day in 10-minute intervals. The resulting load profile is compared against existing algorithms, demonstrating notable improvements. Moreover, the application of dynamic pricing to the optimized load profile, leveraging resources such as battery-powered electric vehicles, solar PV, battery storage, and the primary grid or main grid, has shown promising results. Priority is given to the renewable and local energy storage to minimize cost. Three case studies, each considering weather-driven variations in appliance usage, demonstrate the potential for significant cost reductions. The surplus energy is returned to the primary grid, while in cases of insufficient microgrid supply, the power is drawn from the primary grid.

Existing research primarily addresses cybersecurity by focusing on the optimal placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to ensure topological observability and minimize system costs, followed by developing AI-based attack detection algorithms. However, these studies fail to simultaneously consider system cost, loss in system observability, and false data injection attack (FDIA) detection performance. Thus, this paper proposes a novel approach by formulating this issue as a tri objective functions optimization problem. The proposed approach optimizes PMU allocation to maximize topological observability and minimize system cost while improving the FDIA detection performance using machine learning. Specifically, the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model’s Brier loss is used as an objective function within the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) optimization framework to represent the FDIA detection performance. To demonstrate the proposed approach’s efficacy, it is tested on the IEEE 38-bus distribution system. To verify the strength of the developed KNN classifier, we examined it using seven different metrics: accuracy, brier loss, F1-score, elapsed time, learning curve, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve, and confusion matrix. The simulation results show that the KNN model achieved superior attack classification performance with a top accuracy of 99.99% and a minimal Brier loss of 9.9478× 10<sup>−4</sup> on the ±0.2% PMU observation tolerance dataset.

This paper presents an innovative investigation into the resilience of EV charging infrastructure using a real-time co-simulation testbed, integrating both power network models and communication protocols such as IEC 61850. The study addresses gaps in existing research by implementing a realistic smart grid environment that incorporates EVs, charging stations and communication networks to simulate cyber-physical interactions. Key cyber-attacks, such as remote charging station status and configuration manipulations and their impact on it, are analysed in real-time simulations. Results show that even a relatively small attack utilising an IEEE 9-bus system with two EV charging stations can severely disrupt grid stability. The paper also explores various attacks targeting EV infrastructure, including charging stations, communication protocols, and management systems. The combined effects of cyber-attacks on power consumption and current variation highlight the critical importance of ensuring that charging infrastructure can adapt to sudden changes in demand while maintaining operational integrity."

The study evaluates the system's response under various disturbances. Without wind disturbance, the WHO method outperformed conventional approaches in the PI-based system. With the FOPI controller applied, overshoot further decreased by 46.8% relative to the PI-based system. Under wind disturbances, WHO continued to outperform existing techniques. Overall, the FOPI controller demonstrated superior stability in terms of overshoot and settling time when subjected to dynamic power disturbances, compared to the PI-based system."

    "abstract": "Inverter-dominated isolated/islanded microgrids (IDIMGs) lack infinite buses and have low inertia, resulting in higher sensitivity to disturbances and reduced stability compared to grid-tied systems. Enhancing the resilience of IDIMGs can be achieved by maximizing the system loadability and/or mitigating the expected disturbances such as line switching operations. This paper proposes a two-stage framework based on the deployment of mobile energy storage (MES) to enhance the resilience of IDIMGs. In the first stage, the network configuration and deployment of MES are optimized to maximize the system loadability. The proposed formulation for this stage is a stochastic multi-period mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that maximizes a weighted sum of minimax loadabilities. In the second stage, transitional locations of MES, line-exchange execution sequence, and droop control of dispatchable sources are jointly optimized to mitigate line-switching disturbances that occur when transitioning to the new network configuration obtained in the first stage. The second stage model is a multi-objective MINLP. The proposed models are solved within the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS), utilizing a modified IEEE 33-bus system. Simulations are conducted to assess the significance of each proposed model, and the results reveal remarkable improvements in system loadability with the utilization of the first-stage model and significant reductions in the total switched power with the adoption of the second-stage model."

This provides two important advantages: 1) cases that can be easily determined as either islanding or nonislanding events are flagged as soon as possible without waiting for the full feature set to become available; 2) because the algorithm allows for the use of different sized time windows, features are analyzed in time-scales that fit their natural patterns of temporal evolution. In this article, the proposed classifier is trained and tested using a database of feature vectors, obtained using PSCAD, which were designed to reflect a variety of commonly encountered events on an IEEE 34-bus distribution system. One of the key requirements for the proposed algorithm was that easy cases should be flagged as soon as possible; this property was confirmed by the observation that most events (approx79%) were detected within 10-20 ms, while at the same time retaining a very high detection rate overall cases (>!99%)."

We adopt an anomaly detection approach where a theft detection unit (TDU) based on a regression tree model is designed to detect suspicious data. Historical records of solar irradiance, temperature, and smart meter readings are utilized in the training stage of the detector. The probability density function of the error between the actual readings from DG meters and the predicted generation by the regression model is utilized as a metric to detect suspicious data.

The operator is responsible for optimally routing the EVs to a suitable charging station within the VCS. A new formulation for implementing this novel concept is presented to allow interaction between various VCSs to maximize the profit gained by each VCS as well as minimize the transit charging time and cost for each customer as a measure representing customer satisfaction.

Thus, this paper proposes a new mechanism for reliability assessment including BEVs, with both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes. Three charging strategies: uncontrolled, controlled unidirectional, and controlled bidirectional are considered in this paper to model the interactions between the transportation and electric power systems. A dynamic stochastic consumption model for a fleet of BEVs is developed to be used in the reliability assessment for the distribution networks. This dynamic model takes into consideration the variability and uncertainty of different trip purposes, starting and ending trip times, as well as the corresponding battery consumption in weather conditions. Furthermore, it is composed of two sequential submodels: travel behavior and battery depletion. The first submodel considers trip-related information while the second considers battery-depleted energy.

However, the main issue with the existing BWIM approaches is their limited suitability for simultaneous multiple-vehicle cases on multiple-lane bridges. To address this limitation, in this study, a novel BWIM approach is proposed. The approach is built around the removal of the non-localized portion of the strain response. Keeping the localized portion of the strain response, which is not sensitive to nearby loads, allows for enhanced detection. The superiority of this approach stems from its capability to handle multiple-vehicle cases. These may present with an arbitrary number of trucks and light-weight vehicles, simultaneously passing the bridge in any arbitrary pattern or configuration. To show the applicability of the approach, a finite element (FE) model of a long-span concrete-box-girder bridge was simulated. The model was validated against the experimental data collected under known large events. The FE model was then used to consider single-truck events (for proof-of-concept) as well as complex multiple-truck traffic cases. These were including in-one-row trucks, zigzag patterns, side-by-side trucks, and a combination of several trucks with several light-weight vehicles present. The results demonstrated that the proposed BWIM approach is capable of obtaining the axle weights and gross vehicle weight (GVW) of the traversing trucks. Based on all complex multiple-truck cases, the overall mean absolute errors for GVW and axle weight estimations were 4.5% and 11.3%, respectively."

Stage I is devoted to short-circuit currents calculation while involving different adaptive VI-FCL characteristics.

To ensure optimal utilization of this charging infrastructure, coordination of EV charging demand is essential to achieve grid load balancing and prevent grid overload. In contrast to offline, day-ahead charging scheduling, this work proposes an online, mobility-aware, spatial EV allocation algorithm within a DWC coordination strategy. This strategy allocates EVs requesting charge to the most optimal DWC lanes within an EV charging network (ECN) in an Internet of EVs (IoEVs). A detailed charging request scenario is presented to highlight the required communication for authentication between the EVs and the charging infrastructure, to achieve the desired coordination. Description of the proposed EV allocation algorithm is then presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a hypothetical case study of predicted EV traffic trips in the cities of Dubai and Sharjah, UAE. Upon parameter optimization, results of the conducted analysis reveal that the proposed EV allocation algorithm achieves an almost flattened load profile across the DWC lanes that reduces the PAER by more than 44% in comparison with a shortest distance allocation algorithm, for a maximum 2× increase in trip length, and sufficient received energy to compensate for the energy consumed during the trip.

The renewable-based distributed generators (RDGs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are wildly incorporated in MGs. Optimal day-ahead scheduling of the MG is ahead corner of energy management for cost reduction. In addition, solving the economic load dispatch and day-ahead scheduling of the MG is a complex optimisation problem, especially considering the RDGs, EVCS, and uncertainties in the electrical system. This paper aims to optimise the day-ahead scheduling of the MG with and without a smart charging strategy for electric vehicles. An enhanced manta-ray foraging optimisation (EMRFO) algorithm is proposed to solve this optimisation problem. EMRFO depends upon boosting population diversity and the searching ability of the standard MRFO using strategies. The proposed strategies are based on quasi-oppositional-based learning and local chaotic mutation. The studied MG consists of wind turbines, fuel cells, and diesel generators. The day-ahead scheduling of the MG is solved with and without considering the uncertainties of the load demand and the wind speed. The proposed algorithm for day-ahead scheduling of the MG is compared to well-known algorithms such as anti lion optimisation, particle swarm optimisation, whale optimisation algorithm, sine cosine algorithm, and harmony search algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to these algorithms for solving the optimisation problem. The results show that the generation cost is reduced considerably from 77,745.61 $ to 76,984.2 $ by applying the smart operation strategy."

This mainly impacts the stability of the power received by the EV, particularly with the variation in the EV traveling velocities. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a multi-secondary coil structure with double-sided LCC compensation circuits, to maximize the received power at ±200 mm of lateral misalignment (LTMA) while achieving Zero Phase Angle (ZPA) operation at the resonance frequency. Simulations reveal that the proposed system can deliver 22.5 kW of power to the EV with an efficiency of 90% at a lateral misalignment of ±200 mm."

    "title": "Battery Energy Management Techniques for an Electric Vehicle Traction System — Habibur Rehman",
    "abstract": "This paper presents two battery energy management (BEM) techniques for an electric vehicle (EV) traction system which incorporates an indirect field-oriented (IFO) induction motor (IM) drive system. The main objective of the proposed BEM techniques is to regulate the IM's speed while minimizing the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery bank state of charge (SOC) reduction and state of health (SOH) degradation. In contrast to most of the existing work, the proposed BEM techniques operate without any prior knowledge of driving profiles or road information. The first BEM technique incorporates two cascaded fuzzy logic controllers (CSFLC). In CSFLC, the first fuzzy logic controller (FLC) generates the reference current signal for regulating the motor speed, while the second FLC generates a variable gain that limits the current signal variation based on the battery SOC. The second BEM technique is based on model predictive control (MPC) which generates the current signal for the speed regulation. However, this work introduces a new way of tuning the MPC input weight using battery information. It features a fuzzy tuned model predictive controller (FMPC), where an FLC adjusts the input weight in the MPC objective function such that the battery SOC is considered while generating the command current signal. Furthermore, this work utilizes a model-in-loop strategy comprising a Chen and Mora (CM) battery model and the experimentally obtained battery bank power consumption to estimate the increase in battery bank runtime and lifetime. A real-time implementation is carried out on a prototype EV traction system using the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) and the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (US06) drive cycles. The experimental results validate that the proposed CSFLC and FMPC BEM techniques exhibit a lower reduction in the battery SOC and SOH degradation, thus prolonging the battery bank runtime and lifetime as compared to the conventional FLC and MPC speed regulators. Further experimentation demonstrates the superiority of the FMPC technique over the CSFLC technique due to the lesser computational burden and higher average energy saving."

    "abstract": "Distribution transformers are an integral part of the power distribution system network and emerging smart grids. With the increasing dynamic service requirements of consumers, there is a higher likelihood of transformer failures due to overloading, feeder line faults, and ineffective cooling. As a consequence, their general longevity has been diminished, and the maintenance efforts of utility providers prove inadequate in efficiently monitoring and detecting transformer conditions. Existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) metering points are sparsely allocated in the network, making fault detection in feeder lines limited. To address these issues, this work proposes an IoT system for real-time distribution transformer load monitoring and anomaly detection. The monitoring system consists of a low-cost IoT gateway and sensor module which collects a three-phase load current profile, and oil levels/temperature from a distributed transformer network, specifically at the feeder side. The data are communicated through the publish/subscribe paradigm to a cloud IoT pipeline and stored in a cloud database after processing. An anomaly detection algorithm in the form of Isolation Forest is implemented to intelligently detect likely faults within a time window of 24 h prior. A mobile application was implemented to interact with the cloud database, visualize the real-time conditions of the transformers, and track them geographically. The proposed work can therefore reduce transformer maintenance costs with real-time monitoring and facilitate predictive fault analysis."

Distribution systems were not originally designed to accommodate this continuous prevalence of PEVs, challenging system planners to install parking lots (PLs) that support PEV charging. The literature has presented many studies for planning PLs, although it did not consider the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) contribution to improving system reliability. This paper proposes an optimal planning framework for allocating and sizing the PLs of PEVs incorporating V2G to improve the reliability of distribution systems. A combined probabilistic model of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMCS) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is applied to capture the stochastic existence of PEVs in PLs. Reliability is evaluated based on a group of energy-oriented indices and the customer's annual cost of interruption. A comprehensive investigation is presented to test the proposed framework on a distribution system for grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G case studies. The results show the efficiency of the proposed framework in improving the reliability indices by 12% and reducing the customer cost of interruption by 10.06% while prioritizing critical customers."

Using the synchronous generator (SG) control approach, the microgrid frequency is more stable due to the inertial features of the SG. In this regard, this paper presents a control algorithm for voltage source converters (VSC)-based distributed generators (DGs), which emulates the principal behavior of synchronous machines and can support inertia to the grid and reduce frequency gradients considering the parallel operation of the SG. The controller is designed based on droop control theory, and a supervisory center controller is implemented to maintain system frequency close to a nominal value of the whole microgrid. The simulation results demonstrate that the system frequency is stabilized even in different and sudden load changes in the island mode where the microgrid is fed by multiple VSC units and a SG.

Also, in most of the SHM-BWIM systems, the trucks’ transverse position change is not appropriately considered as a potential source of false alarms. In this study, a multiple-presence dual-purpose (MPDP) SHM approach is proposed to monitor bridge integrity using the existing BWIM system sensors in single and multiple-truck events. This approach centers on the influence line (IL) change and applies a recently developed multiple-presence IL (MP-IL) technique to the SHM domain for the first time in the literature. This can effectively handle the multiple presence issue to make the integrated system more practical. Also, the proposed procedure studies the impact of transverse position changes to provide a more realistic bridge health monitoring approach. To show the approach applicability, an existing long-span concrete-box-girder bridge was modeled and validated against a set of experimental data using known large events. Eleven damage scenarios were simulated to evaluate the MPDP approach under single and multiple truck events. Based on the results, the MPDP SHM procedure coupled with the novel MP-IL could effectively detect the damage scenarios in both single and multiple-truck events, even when the transverse position changed."

Thus, solving the optimal protection coordination (OPC) problem for the main network topology results in protection miscoordination under contingencies. Further, the limited fault currents of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) require a highly sensitive and reliable protection scheme. This paper proposes an overcurrent protection scheme for islanded microgrids powered by droop-based IIDGs. The inverter controller is modified to include a virtual impedance-fault current limiter (VI-FCL) to protect inverter switches from overcurrent and limit IIDG fault currents. The VI-FCL is designed such that it adapts to fault severity. OPC of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) is achieved using a two-stage optimization algorithm. The first Stage calculates the short-circuit currents involving various fault resistances. Next, constraints on the DOCRs operation times are formulated for each topology resulting from an N-1 contingency and the main topology. The OPC problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem. Finally, the second Stage is dedicated to obtaining the DOCRs optimal settings.

However, islanding detection in such a grid-tied distributed generation (GTDG) network is the topmost challenge to ensure power quality and reliable operation. This paper presents a modified passive islanding detection scheme (MPIDS) for the GTDG network, using a One-D recursive Median filter (ODRMF) algorithm. Firstly, at the point of common coupling (PCC), 3-phase voltage is acquired. Next, the ODRMF is employed to extract 3rd harmonic and residuals from the acquired voltage signal. Afterward, two novel islanding detection indices developed are: (1) First change detection (FCD), which is calculated from the residuals, and (2) delta selected harmonic distortion (∆SHD), which is computed from 3rd harmonic content of the voltage signal. Finally, variations in the two indices are compared with the threshold to identify islanding. To validate the efficacy of the presented MPIDS, rigorous simulations in MATLAB/ Simulink are conducted on the UL-1741 and IEEE 13-bus GTDGs systems under different conditions. The results illustrate that the presented strategy is highly reliable in all assessed conditions and can detect the islanding as well as non-islanding incidents effectively under balanced and unbalanced load/generation conditions with a very low non-detection zone."

DG and DSM have facilitated the sharing of excess power by customers to the grid, and then to their peers through the grid as a trading agent. Although the concept of integrating Peer-to-Peer energy trading with DSM has been explored by scholars and relatively established trading frameworks, there are very limited research performed in respect to the UAE market in terms of its acceptance and readiness towards this energy trading market. This research aims to explore the perception of Peer-to-Peer electricity trading within the Power Distribution Network in the United Arab Emirates. The study will review the Smart Grid network in the UAE and will obtain insights on people’s perception of the transition from classical electricity network to Smart Grid. It will also look into peoples’ perception regarding the transition from being electricity consumers to being electricity producers that trade among peers through semi-structured interviews. This will enhance the understanding of the energy trading market between self-generated power producers connected to a network grid, where the consumer will be utilizing the excess power available in the form of electricity trading, by importing and exporting power, without adding any additional power to the grid. The outcome of the study will provide an insight on the UAE electricity market by designing an electricity trading model that is built upon the following vital factors: power quality, supply reliability, type of integration, peers, and trading time.

    "abstract": "Worldwide, transportation electrification and photovoltaics (PVs) have become vital components of modern and future planning problems. Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives, a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II) and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80% EVs penetration increases the net profit by 85.36% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both charging and waiting time."

The energy management of the MMGs is a strenuous and challenging task, especially with the integration of renewable energy resources (RERs) and variation in the loading due to the intermittency of these resources and the stochastic nature of the load demand. In this regard, the energy management of the MMGs is optimized with optimal inclusion of a hybrid system consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) and a wind turbine (WT)-based distributed generation (DGs) under uncertainties of the generated powers and the load variation. A modified Capuchin Search Algorithm (MCapSA) is presented and applied for the energy management of the MMGs. The MCapSA is based on enhancing the searching abilities of the standard Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA) using three improvement strategies including the quasi-oppositional-based learning (QOBL), the random movement-based Levy flight distribution, and the exploitation mechanism of the prairie dogs in the prairie dog optimization (PDO).

Optimal operation and coordination of these microgrid resources are crucial for satisfying electrical and thermal demands with minimal cost and achieving eco-friendly operation. To this end, this paper proposes a stochastic multi-objective optimization approach for optimal operation and coordination of RES, EH systems, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The EH includes compressed air energy storage, battery energy storage, and thermal energy storage. The objective functions to be minimized are operating costs and emissions. The proposed approach considers the uncertainties of RES, electrical and thermal demands, electrical prices during seasonal-based horizons, the stochastic nature of PEV's owners' driving habits, and various microgrid operational constraints. Furthermore, a price-based demand response program is employed considering the end-user's discomfort. The multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is employed to solve the proposed optimization problem and obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions.

Recently, EVs are involved in peak-shaving processes where their vehicle-to-grid operation mode can be used to supply power to the grid in times of peak load. On the other hand, the frequency of extreme events and man-made attacks (cyber and physical attacks) is in a dramatic increased in recent years. These events have severe impacts on power systems whether they cause long outage times or major equipment destruction. The first step against these attacks is to understand how they are built and their impact on the power system. This paper investigates the impact of the false data injection (FDI) attacks on EV chargers and distributed generation resources (DGs) of the active distribution networks (ADN). FDI attacks focus on the operation of the distribution system optimal power flow (DSOPF) analysis to increase the losses in the system and accordingly, increase the costs. For the analysis of the FDI attack impacts, the IEEE-38 bus balanced power distribution system is considered, with distributed energy resources (DERs) along the system represented by bidirectional interactive EVs (BIEV), dispatchable DG units, and wind power plants. A 24-hour AC DSOPF is performed on General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software, where the changes in the status of a set of EV chargers and voltage profile are resulted along with an increase in the injected power from DERs which consequently lead to an increase in system losses and DSOPF cost."

The control parameters, at the top of which the active and reactive droop gains, $m_{p}$ and $n_{q}$ , respectively, have been recently studied, evaluating their impact on stability. Furthermore, the stability domain chart is plotted in the $m_{p,max}{-n}_{q}$ plane identifying the stable range of the microgrid, enabling the microgrid operator to choose the desired stable operating point based on frequency, voltage, and power-sharing requirements. However, the microgrid is prone to abnormal conditions, such as network disconnection, distributed generator (DG) disconnection, and load disconnection, that also affect microgrid stability. Hence, this can have an impact on the stability domain and, consequently, the choice of droops for stable operation. Therefore, in this paper, several stability domain charts are proposed, considering all various contingencies. The proposed network disconnection, DG disconnection, and load disconnection domain charts have been combined to generate an overall stability domain chart considering $\\boldsymbol {N} -1$ contingency. The proposed $\\boldsymbol {N} -1$ contingency chart is of crucial importance in considering the microgrid stability for both normal and abnormal operations. $\\boldsymbol {N} -1$ contingencies can be frequent in microgrid operation due to microgrid limited space and power nature. Hereby, the inclusion of their impact on microgrid stability provides better guidance for the tuning of the control parameters. Moreover, the proposed chart is tested and validated using time-domain simulations on MATLAB, considering different operating points. The simulation results highlight the significance of the stability domain chart for selecting the DG droop gains to maintain the microgrid stability considering $\\boldsymbol {N} -1$ contingency. Further, real-time validation of the proposed domain of stability through OPAL-RT setup is analyzed to confirm the ability of practical controllers to respond to microgrid variations conditions in real-time operation."

    "abstract": "Unit commitment (UC) is one of the core decisions in electricity markets and system planning. Existing optimization methods either use DC approximation of network constraints or decompose and relax them into subproblems, which may lead to suboptimal/infeasible decisions or require execution times longer than those for the industry. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have proven their ability to find fast near-optimal UC decisions. However, they suffer from the curses of dimensionality and/or lack feasibility guarantees. This paper proposes a new hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the UC problem with AC network constraints (AC-UC). The problem is formulated as a modified-action Markov decision process model and the fundamental soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is enhanced to deal with hybrid action spaces. To ensure the solution feasibility, two action filters are designed based on logic constraints of generation units and sequential convex programming for the discrete and continuous actions, respectively. The hybrid SAC is improved by embedding the two filters and a prioritized experience buffer for fast convergence and stable learning. Simulation results on four test systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the superiority over traditional methods in computational efficiency and feasibility. Moreover, the presented method is extended to solve stochastic UC and security-constraint UC problems."

Environmental conditions, structural systems, bridge configuration, geographic location, and traffic data are some of the major factors that affect the development of deterioration modules. This emphasizes the need for the development of deterioration models that reflect the local conditions. In this article, some of the most important factors that could help in developing deterioration models in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were identified. The research was conducted in three phases; in the first phase, an extensive literature search was conducted to identify factors adopted in different deterioration models, and in phase two, the most relevant factors to the GCC environment were selected and these factors were further reduced based on input from local bridge experts. The result from the second phase is a list of factors identified by the experts. The identified list was utilized in phase three, which was focused on conducting a survey targeting bridge engineers to help identify the final selection and rank the factors according to their importance level. The results indicate that steel reinforcement protection, design load, chloride attack, type of defect, and age are the most important factors impacting bridge deterioration in the GCC. In addition, the time of rehabilitation; average daily truck traffic, ADTT; and average daily traffic, ADT, are the second most important factors. Factors with medium importance level are deck protection, services under the bridge, and inspection gap. The least important set of factors include temperature and wind load."

    "abstract": "Protection coordination is typically approached considering the main network configuration. Nevertheless, contingencies such as generator or line failures may disrupt power grids. Low fault currents in inverter-based isolated microgrids adversely impact the conventional overcurrent protection schemes. This paper proposes a sensitive and selective protection scheme for isolated microgrids using an adaptive third harmonic voltage generated by inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs) and adapted to fault severity. The generated harmonic voltage results in a harmonic layer established during faults and is decoupled from the fundamental fault current, which is limited by IBDGs. Harmonic directional overcurrent relays sense the generated harmonic currents and voltages at the relay location to ensure optimal protection coordination (OPC). The OPC problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear program to determine the optimal relays’ settings. The constraints are defined for the isolated configuration and each potential configuration resulting from an N-1 contingency. A radial microgrid that is part of a Canadian urban distribution network is used to ensure the successful operation of the proposed protection scheme. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to protect isolated microgrids and preserve protection coordination without communication."

In the context of smart grids, where millions of interconnected electronic devices span from power generation units to customer interface units through communication networks, the reliability of electrical infrastructure and information security face immediate challenges.

The inclusion of DERs and smart components introduces security vulnerabilities through their remote control and communication capabilities. Although the impact of cyber-attacks on LV networks, typically leading to localized power outages, has received limited investigation, the potential for national consequences remains largely unexplored, especially when a cyber-attack targets a microgrid system.

The microgrids are operated in on-grid mode (OGM) with the utility grid, and isolation mode (IM) without the utility grid. This dual operational mode causes protection and control challenges in the microgrids. This research paper suggests an advanced hardware-supported fault detection, phase identification & localization method for AC microgrids. The scheme deploys a Discrete Kalman Filter (DKF) for state estimation of voltage and current signals. Then, a Mathematical Morphology (MM) is engaged for generating a novel fault detection/classification index named segregated energy signature (SES) from estimated voltage and current signals. The system is considered to be faulty if the SES is higher than a predefined threshold setting, while phase identification is achieved by default because of the per-phase implementation of DKF&MM. Moreover, the directional features of the cumulative energy signature (CES) are also computed from MM-based non-fundamental current and voltage to localize the faulty section. The established scheme is tested on the CIGRE microgrid benchmark test bed on Matlab-Simulink software. In addition, the suggested method is also examined on the dSPACE MicroLab testing hardware setup in the Smart grid lab at USPCAS-E, NUST, Pakistan. The result illustrates that the proposed scheme successfully detects, classifies, and localizes the low impedance fault (LIF) as well as high impedance fault (HIF) in both operational modes and topological structures with 96.6% accuracy."

Therefore, a reliable and robust protection method has become of paramount importance for such MDG-based microgrids. This article suggests an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to detect, classify, and locate faults in such MDG-based microgrids. Initially, the harmonic content is generated from the UKF-estimated current signal to compute the total harmonic RMS factor (THRF). Then the changes in the THRF of each phase are cross-checked to a pre-specified threshold level to distinguish the fault conditions. Furthermore, the cumulative covariance-dependent reactive energy (CCDRE) is computed from both the estimated state and covariance matrix of voltage and current signals provided by UKF. Finally, the directional trends in the CCDRE are used to identify the fault zone in the microgrids. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through ample simulations on CIGRE and IEC 61,850–7–420 microgrid test system via MATLAB® Simulink. The results illustrate that the presented strategy is robust in both the GC mode and the ID mode of operation in meshed and radial topologies with 99.9% accuracy."

As the use of grid-connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems continues to increase with the use of intelligent PV inverters, the susceptibility of these systems to cyber attacks and their potential impact on grid stability emerges as a critical concern based on the inverter control models. This study explores the cyber-threat consequences of selectively targeting the components of PV systems, with a special focus on the inverter and Overcurrent Protection Relay (OCR). This research also evaluates the interconnectedness between these two components under different cyber-attack scenarios. A three-phase radial Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is employed for grid modeling and transient analysis under different cyber attacks. The findings of our analysis highlight the complex relationship between vulnerabilities in inverters and relays, emphasizing the consequential consequences of affecting one of the components on the other. In addition, this work aims to evaluate the impact of cyber attacks on the overall performance and stability of grid-connected PV systems. For example, in the attack on the PV inverters, the OCR failed to identify and eliminate the fault during a pulse signal attack with a short duration of 0.1 s. This resulted in considerable harmonic distortion and substantial power losses as a result of the protection system’s failure to recognize and respond to the irregular attack signal. Our study provides significant contributions to the understanding of cybersecurity in grid-connected solar PV systems. It highlights the importance of implementing improved protective measures and resilience techniques in response to the changing energy environment towards smart grids."

Here, modern adaptive OCR coordination approaches using different group settings has integrated in evaluating high voltage/medium/low voltage (HV/MV/LV) network model with real network parameters at the MV/LV level. Additionally, a voltage-based relay is developed and employed to enhance protection system performance under various cyber threats, aiming to reduce tripping time and to minimize energy that is not supplied. The results show that voltage-based scheme outperform the traditional adaptive OCRs in terms of response time and mis coordination events under cyber-attacks.

This paper presents a new adaptive Overcurrent Relay (OCR) protection and investigates the resilience of different traditional and new adaptive OCR protection schemes against various cyber-physical threats in a smart grid environment. Key contributions include the implementation of a novel adaptive protection scheme designed to dynamically adjust OCR settings based on real-time grid conditions, improving flexibility and responsiveness in managing grid variations induced by DER integration and operational changes. The proposed scheme is validated and implemented using the Multifunction Protection Relay SIEMENS 7SJ62, following to the programming standards of IEC 61131–3, ensuring the reliability and practical applicability of the adaptive OCR scheme in real-world scenarios. Additionally, a dedicated testbed is developed to simulate real-time cyber-physical interactions, incorporating hardware components such as the SIEMENS 7SJ62 and OMICRON-256 test device, along with high-performance computers and communication networks to facilitate comprehensive evaluations of adaptive OCR schemes under varying operational conditions. The study also examines the implications of real-time cyber-attacks on power system operations and the effectiveness of adaptive OCR protection schemes, addressing cybersecurity concerns and proposing mitigation strategies to the system resilience."

    "abstract": "Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity."

    "abstract": "The deployment of 5G networks and IoT devices in smart grid applications provides electricity-generated, distributed, and managed bidirectional transmission of real-time information between utility providers and consumers. However, this increased transmission and confidence in IoT devices also present novel security challenges, since they are vulnerable to malicious attacks. Ensuring robust attack detection mechanisms in 5G-IoT smart grid systems for reliable and efficient power distribution, and early accurate identification of attacks addressed. To solve these concerns, a novel technique called Target Projection Regressed Gradient Convolutional Neural Network (TPRGCNN) is introduced to improve the accuracy of attack detection during data transmission in a 5G-IoT smart grid environment. The TPRGCNN method is combined with feature selection and classification for improving secure data transmission by detecting attacks in 5G-IoT smart grid networks. In the feature selection process, TPRGCNN utilizes the Ruzicka coefficient Dichotonic projection regression method and aims to enhance the accuracy of attack detection while minimizing time complexity. Then selected significant features are fed into Jaspen's correlative stochastic gradient convolutional neural learning classifier for attack detection. Classification indicates whether transmission is normal or an attack in the 5G-IoT smart grid network. The implementation results demonstrate that the proposed TPRGCNN method achieve a 5% of improved attack detection accuracy and 2% improvement in precision, recall, F-score while reducing time complexity and space complexity by 13% and 23% compared to conventional methods."

    "abstract": "With the growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in global transportation markets, accurate EV demand predictions are essential to enable optimal sizing and operation of the EV charging systems and the power distribution networks. As a result, different EV load forecasting models are developed in the literature using several statistical and machine learning tools. Nonetheless, the significance and reliability of these models are affected by the data volume and the correlations between the different features, which may not be guaranteed with the available open-source EV charging data. In fact, the scarcity of accessible data on EV charging and driving patterns hinders the development of accurate EV load forecasting models. This work addresses this problem by adopting an Autoformer-based deep learning model to predict the EV charging load using an open source charger dataset from 51 public charging stations in Boulder, Colorado, U.S. EV load predictions for 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days are obtained using the proposed Autoformer model to evaluate its long-term forecasting cabability. Results reveal that the Autoformer model offers 15% improvement in the root mean squared error (RMSE) over traditional long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based predictors for the 30-day time span, and more than 50% improvement for the 90-day time span. This confirms the reliability of the proposed model for long-term EV load forecasting by effectively capturing the dynamics of the EV charging load data."

The paper employs numerical simulations to investigate the impact of various working fluids such as helium, air, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide on the energy separation in the vortex tube, using the SST k- ω turbulence model with viscous heating. A three-dimensional numerical investigation is sued to examine the effect of a single fluid property on vortex tube performance, while keeping the rest of the fluid properties unchanged, which is impossible to achieve via experimental study. The numerical investigation examines the influence of molecular weight, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and dynamic viscosity on energy separation. The results show that energy separation performance improves with lower molecular weight and heat capacity, and higher dynamic viscosity of the working fluids, while no impact of the thermal conductivity is observed. Out of five gases tested in this study, helium has yielded the maximum temperature separation, while carbon dioxide has yielded the lowest performance. Results show that viscous dissipation contributes to the temperature separation in vortex tube."

An acoustic signal measurement is utilized to localize the PD location. Unlike conventional EKF methods, where the correction term used to update the state is linearly proportional to the output error, the correction term of the proposed algorithm is independent of the output error, resulting in a fast response with a significant reduction in the estimation error. In contrast to the EKF, the proposed method can successfully mimic the nonlinear dynamics and mitigate measurement noise stochasticity. Moreover, even if the measurement model fails to fully capture the PD's dynamics, the IEKF will still sustain a reasonable performance. In contrast, conventional EKFs can easily diverge if a mismatch between the measurement model and the true measurement occurs. Experimental results are shown to verify the proposed method's performance compared to a recently published variant of the EKF."

This paper proposes a sensitive and selective protection scheme for islanded microgrids using a third harmonic voltage generated by inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs). The generated harmonic voltage results in a harmonic layer formed during short-circuit faults and is decoupled from the fundamental fault current, i.e., limited by IIDGs. Further, the generated harmonic voltage is adaptively adjusted based on fault severity to enhance protection sensitivity and obtain a universal set of relays' settings. The proposed protection scheme utilizes harmonic directional overcurrent relays (HDOCRs) equipped with a dual-setting time-current-voltage setting that sense the generated harmonic voltages and currents at the relay location to ensure optimal protection coordination (OPC) of islanded microgrids. The OPC with the proposed dual-setting is formulated as a constrained nonlinear program to determine the optimal forward and reverse relays' settings. The proposed scheme is tested on the Canadian benchmark urban distribution system and compared to the conventional protection scheme, which relies only on a single time-current-voltage trip characteristic. The results ensure the ability of the proposed scheme to protect islanded microgrids without communication and its capability to reduce relays' operation times."

This work investigates the use of FOPI controllers on a prototype electric vehicle (EV) traction system consisting of an Indirect Field Oriented Control (IFOC) based induction motor (IM) system. The overall setup is driven by an inverter, powered by an SOOV Li-ion battery bank. The main focus of this paper is comparison of the battery bank temperature and overall speed regulation performance when speed regulation is done via FOPI or integer order Proportional Integral (PI) control. Two major classes of tests are considered, first the performance of a Ziegler Nichols (ZN)-PI controller is compared against an FOPI controller tuned via existing rules in the literature. Then, the FOPI controller is made to use the same gains as the ZN-PI controller, but only the order of the integral is varied to non-integer values lesser than unity. Comparison based on simulation results show that simply using the ZN-PI gains but changing the order of the integral to values lower than unity, has definite effects on battery temperature, and SOC, and without sacrificing speed regulation performance compared to a tuned FOPI controller or a using a tuned PI controller. This has the potential to help in comparison of controller behavior from the point of view of protecting and extending the life of an EV battery bank. Because small temperature increases if sustained over a long time, may significantly harm an EV's battery bank."

This study aims to predict combustion pressure from flame images, which provide more comprehensive information about the combustion process than traditional pressure sensors. The flame images were captured from a single-cylinder 4-stroke optical gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine at 1000 rpm, 5.7 bar IMEP, and stoichiometric combustion conditions using a high-speed camera. To achieve this prediction, we employed five different models: EfficientNetB4, ResNet50, Ensemble Adversarial Inception ResNet, convolutional neural network (CNN), and CNN-XGBoost. The training dataset comprised 1350 flame images captured from a single-cylinder optical GDI engine across different combustion stages. To ensure robustness, 150 images were used for validation. The models were subjected to a testing set of 4500 flame images obtained from different cycles, to evaluate how well they could perform on new, unseen data. The results showed that EfficientNetB4 achieved an impressive R<sup>2</sup> of 0.94 and a low RMSE of 0.70 compared to other tested models. Saliency analysis revealed that the model focuses on subtle flame characteristics and areas without intense flames, which suggests that it detects features invisible to the human eye. Additionally, the proposed deep learning approach is applied for the sake of monitoring cycle-to-cycle variations based on in-cylinder flame propagation where it is found that it produces high accuracy compared to those obtained through pressure sensors. Our findings are intended to advance the adoption of machine learning approaches for assisting in engine design and optimization."
